  <title>Creating and Interacting with a Domain Model</title>

  <para>One of the key steps in building a tool to support a specific
  application domain, is to precisely capture the domain concepts that the
  tool will manipulate.</para>

  <para>To do this, we need to construct a <emphasis>domain model</emphasis>.
  A domain model captures the key concepts in the domain, along with their
  properties and relationships. For example, if the domain is business
  processes, then we would aim to capture all the concepts of a business
  process (activities, flow, constraints, etc) in the model.</para>

  <para>This part describes how to <emphasis>model</emphasis> the concepts in
  a domain. It describes how to capture the domain concepts as class models,
  and how the model can be enriched with constraints, operations and
  constructors. It then shows how the powerful dynamic capabiltites of
  XMF-Mosaic can be used to validate the domain model, through the creation of
  model instances and by executing the model.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Example</title>

    <para>The example we are going to use is a simple component modelling
    domain. This domain deals with capturing information about the components
    in a system, their interfaces (ports) and their connections to one another
    (connectors).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>Boot up XMF-Mosaic.</para>

    <para>The first step in creating a model is to create a project.</para>

    <para>From the file menu, select New Project.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/afilenewproject.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Alternatively, the same operation can be called by right clicking on
    the User project in the browser.</para>

    <para>A new empty project with a default name appears in the MyProrjects
    project tree.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/anewproject.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>We want the name of the project to reflect what it contains, so the
    project name is selected and changed to “Components”.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/unamedproject.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>By default, a project contains a <emphasis>package</emphasis> - this
    is where the model will reside.</para>

    <para>The package can be viewed by expanding the (Component) project icon
    by clicking on the cross. By default it has the same name as the
    project.</para>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Constructing a Domain Model</title>

    <para>We are now going to create a domain model of the concepts in the
    component modelling domain. We will do this using a class model. This
    model will focus primarily on describing the concepts in the
    domain.</para>

    <para>The model can be constructed as follows:</para>

    <para>First, right click on the Components package in the browser and
    select Create Diagram &gt; Class Diagram.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/creatingaclassdiagram.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>A class diagram editor will be shown.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Adding Classes</title>

      <para>In order to add a class to the model select the Class button and
      click on the diagram. The newly added class is automatically given a
      default name.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/unamedclass.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Click on the class name to change or amend it. In this case, we
      will change the name of Class0 to ComponentModel.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/namedclass.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The properties of the class can be edited by right clicking on the
      class and selecting Edit.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/classpropertyedit.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The property editor tells us that:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The element being edited (self) is ComponentModel.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>It is an instance of the class Class.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>It has no attributes (see right hand panel).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Its name is ComponentModel.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>It is owned by the Components package.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>We can ignore the grammar and default properties for now.</para>

      <para>Let's add another class. This time a class called
      NamedElement.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/namedelement.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>We want to make this abstract (i.e. non-instantiable). To do this,
      right click on the class and select Edit. In the class's property editor
      tick the isAbstract box. The name of the class will become italicised to
      indicate that it is now an abstract class.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/changetoabstract.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Let's add some more domain concepts to the model.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Adding Attributes</title>

      <para>Attributes are variables owned by a class. Attributes are used to
      represent properties of a class. They have a name and a type.</para>

      <para>The class NamedElement requires an attribute 'name' of type
      String. This is added by left clicking on the selected class. From the
      Add Element menu select an Attribute of type String.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/addinganattribute.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Double click on the attribute name in the class box and change it
      to 'name'.</para>

      <para>Attributes can also have a class as their type. They are
      represented as named arrows connecting the owner of the attribute to the
      class that is its type. Note, this use of attributes are similar to
      uni-directional associations in UML.</para>

      <para>The relationship between a Component and a Port can be described
      by an attribute "ports" whose owner is a Component, and whose type is a
      Port.</para>

      <para>Let's add this attribute to the model. First select the Attribute
      button in the toolbar. Select the Component class and then drag the edge
      to the Port class. Edit the name of the attribute by clicking on it. In
      this case, we are going to change it to "ports".</para>

      <para>Note, the name of the attribute can be moved by left clicking on
      it and dragging it with the mouse.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/addinganattributeedge.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The attribute edge can be moved by clicking on it, and moving the
      cursor over the waypoint. A drag icon will appear. Click and drag the
      edge to the required position. This can also be used to add waypoints to
      the line.</para>

      <para>A default multiplicity of <emphasis role="bold">one</emphasis> is
      associated with the newly added attribute. Change the multiplicity by
      right clicking on the attribute line and selecting the appropriate
      multiplicity. In this case a Component is associated with <emphasis
      role="bold">many </emphasis>Ports, so select * (many):</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/addingmultiplicity.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Adding Associations</title>

      <para>Associations represent bi-directional relationships between two
      classes. In XMF-Mosaic, an association is equivalent to a pair of
      attributes owned by two classes and a constraint which guarantees that
      there is a round-trip relationship between the attributes.</para>

      <para>As an example, an association is required between the classes
      ComponentModel and Component.</para>

      <para>The relationship we want to capture is that a ComponentModel
      contains many Components, and a Component is owned by a
      ComponentModel.</para>

      <para>To create an Association, select the Association tool button and
      drag the edge from the ComponentModel to the Component. Change the names
      of the association ends as shown below. The multiplicity of each
      association end is changed by <emphasis role="bold">right clicking on
      its role name </emphasis>and selecting Multiplicity.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/addinganassociation.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <para>A more comprehensive Components model can now be constructed. Here
    further attributes have been added, along with two generalizations. The
    latter ensure that the Component and Port classes inherit the name
    attribute from the class NamedElement.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/model.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Note: right click on an edge and select Straighten to straighten an
    edge.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Using the Property Editor</title>

    <para>The property editor provides some useful features for viewing and
    managing the properties of model elements. Right clicking and selecting
    Edit on an element will display a property editor for that element. For
    example, editing the package Components (in the browser) will show the
    properties of the package:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/propertyeditpackage.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Single value properties (slots) are displayed on the left hand of
    the property editor. For instance, the package Components has a name slot
    whose value is "Component" and an owned slot whose value is the "Root"
    package. The "of" slot is the class that the element is an instance "of",
    in this case, a Package.</para>

    <para>Double clicking on the value of a slot will display a property
    editor for that element, for example clicking on the Component class in
    the classes list will show the property editor for the class
    Component..</para>

    <para>One of the powerful features of XMF-Mosaic is its uniform
    representation of its own implementation. To see this, double cllck on the
    "of" slot. This will display a property editor for the class Package - the
    class that defines what a package is.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/packagedit.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>When navigating through the properties of large models, it is often
    useful to be able to quickly flick back to previous property editors.
    Rather than displaying hundreds of tabs, XMF-Mosaic provides buttons for
    managing property editor histories. These can be found in the top right
    hand bar of the property editor. The left and right hand arrows allow you
    to move between previous and next editors in the history.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/propertyedit.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>A list of all the editors can be seen by clicking on the up and down
    arrows. A history can be deleted by clicking on the eraser icon. Finally,
    property editors can be kept as tabs by clicking on the lock icon - when a
    new property editor is shown, it will be displayed in a new tab. This is
    useful when comparing two or more properties.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Saving and Loading</title>

    <para>Save the project by right clicking on the project in the browser and
    selecting Save As or Save. Files are saved in a .xar file.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/savingamodel.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Saving the project for the first time requires that it is given a
    name, for example Components.xar.</para>

    <para>Subsequent saves will save the project under the same name. Save As
    can be used to save the project under a different name.</para>

    <para>A backup (.xar.bak) file is also be saved.</para>

    <para>Projects can be loaded by selecting Open Project ... from the File
    menu. Choose the project to load from the file chooser.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Interacting with Models</title>

    <para>A key difference between XMF-Mosaic and other modelling tools is
    that its models are fully interactive. In XMF-Mosaic you can create and
    visualise instances of models in a variety of different ways, and then
    write operations, transformations, etc. that do things with the models.
    The ability to interact with models is essential when capturing and
    validating detailed properties of a complex problem domain. In addition,
    because XMF-Mosaic is itself completely modelled, all the properties of
    the tool can be accessed in exactly the same way, resulting in a
    consistent and highly interoperable approach to tool definition.</para>

    <para>The following sections describe these facilities in detail.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Snapshots</title>

    <para>Snapshots provide a visual way of interacting with instances of a
    model. A snapshot is a diagram that contains instances of classes in
    package.</para>

    <para>Note, snapshots are intended to provide a simple visual way of
    viewing instances, but they can become difficult to read if they are
    applied to large numbers of objects.</para>

    <para>To create a snapshot of a specific package right click on a package
    in the model browser and select Create Snapshot. Instances of the classes
    in the package (or its sub-packages) can now be created.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/creatingasnapshot.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Add objects by selecting the Object button and then clicking onto
    the diagram. The list of object types that can be created will be
    displayed. Select the appropriate one and it will be added to the
    snapshot.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/chooseanobject.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>For example, a Component can be added to the diagram.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/exampleobject.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>The value of primitive slot (attribute) values can be changed by
    double clicking on the values in the object.</para>

    <para>It is also possible to change the name of the object by clicking on
    it.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/changingobjectname.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Links can be created between objects by selecting the Slot Value
    button and connecting the owning object to the target object. As an
    example, add an instance of the class ComponentModel to the snapshot and
    create a link between the ComponentModel instance and the Component
    instance.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/snapshotlink.png" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Slot names will be assigned automatically where possible (as shown
    here), but a choice of slot names will be provided if there is more than
    one possible attribute that the slot can be an instance of.</para>

    <para>A complete snapshot of the model can be created as illustrated
    below. This represents a simple Component model, in which two components
    (Displays and Navigation) are connected together. The Displays component
    expects to receive the current position from the Navigation
    component.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/snapshotexample.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Just like other model elements in XMF-Mosaic, objects can be edited
    (using right click &gt; Edit). Here is the result of editing
    object2.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/objectedit.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <section>
      <title>Creating Standalone Snapshots</title>

      <para>Sometimes it is useful to create instances of elements in another
      package or project, for example, when we want to manage them separately
      from the model. To do this, first create a snapshot in the project which
      the snapshot is to be saved under. Next select the snapshot in the
      browser and right click &gt; Set Parents. A list of all available
      packages will be shown. Select the appropriate package, and the snapshot
      can now be populated with instances of the selected package.</para>

      <para>As an example, here is a separate snapshot project that has been
      created for the Components model:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/seperatesnapshotexample.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Dealing with Sequences</title>

      <para>Snapshots can also accommodate the ordering of objects in a
      collection. As an example, imagine we want to extend the Components
      model to accommodate ports with sequences of parameters. The extended
      model is shown below:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/modelwithparameters.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Our example snapshot can be extended as follows:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/sequenceorderingsnap.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Objects can be re-ordered by right clicking on the owning object,
      in this case object4, and re-ordering the elements:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/sequenceordering.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Edit the objects in the diagram to find out which objects are
      associated with each id. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Synchronisation between Snapshots and Class Models</title>

      <para>In XMF-Mosaic, snapshots are designed to stay in step with class
      models, even if changes are made to the class model. As an example,
      let's imagine that we want to delete the attribute, type, from a Port as
      we will defer it to a parameter. We can delete type from Port and add it
      to the Parameter instead. The snapshot remains in sync, the type slot
      has been removed from the Port objects and has been added to the
      Parameter objects: </para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/snapshotupdated.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Creating Multiple Views of Snapshots</title>

      <para>Just as with class diagrams, multiple views of the same snapshot
      can be created in XMF-Mosaic. This is very useful when you wish to
      capture different aspects of a model instance, and can considerably
      reduce the size of the snapshots you create.</para>

      <para>To create a new snapshot, simply right click on the snapshot and
      select Create &gt; Snapshot Diagram. This will create a partial (empty
      view) of the snapshot. Adding more objects to it will add new objects to
      the snapshot.</para>

      <para>To create a total (synchronised view), select Create &gt; Snapshot
      Diagram (Total View). This will create a diagram containing all the
      objects in the snapshot.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Exporting Snapshots</title>

      <para>There are two main ways that snapshot (instance data) can be
      exported: as XOCL and as XML.</para>

      <para>To export a snapshot as XOCL, right click on a the snapshot and
      select Deploy &gt; Snapshot.</para>

      <para>Choose where to put the file. A .xmf file will be generated
      containing XOCL code. Here is the XOCL for the Components
      snapshot:</para>

      <programlisting>parserImport XOCL;

context Root
  @Snapshot snapshot0

    object0 = Root::Components::ComponentModel[
                  connectors = Set{object5};
                  components = Set{object1,object3} ]
    object5 = Root::Components::Connector[
                  source = object2;
                  target = object4 ]
    object4 = Root::Components::Port[
                  name = "CurrentPosition";
                  type = "LatLong" ]
    object1 = Root::Components::Component[
                  ports = Set{object2};
                  name = "Displays";
                  owner = object0 ]
    object2 = Root::Components::Port[

    <title>Saving and Loading Diagram Layout</title>

    <para>It is possible to save and load the layout of a diagram, so that
    when it is imported in an un-formatted way, its layout can be
    reconstructed. This is useful when re-constructing snapshots saved as XML
    or XOCL (see above), or when working with class models written in
    code.</para>

    <para>To save the diagram layout, right click on the diagram and choose

  <section>
    <title>Adding Constraints</title>

    <para>A class diagram can only capture certain information about the
    concepts and relationships in a domain. To add extra information,
    XMF-Mosaic provides a language for conveniently writing constraints and
    operations on models. This language is called <emphasis
    role="bold">XOCL</emphasis> (eXtensible Object Command Language). XOCL is
    based on OCL (the Object Constraint Language). See the XOCL walkthrough
    for more details.</para>

    <para>To add a constraint, right click on a class in the class diagram or
    in the browser and choose New&gt;Constraint. A new constraint is added to
    the browser under the class. Click on it to show the constraint property
    editor.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/addingaconstraing.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>The constraint property editor provides a text window for entering
    constraint expressions.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/constrainteditor.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>The maximise button can be used to expand the window if
    required.</para>

    <para>The following expression is added to the constraint. Right click
    &gt; Commit Changes to update the model with the new constraint. Edit self
    to change the constraint name.</para>

        <imagedata fileref="Images/constraintexample.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>This constraint states that a connector should only connect two port
    if they are of the same type.</para>

    <para>Note the code box will turn a tasteful shade of pink when the code
    changes. This will clear when the code is successfully committed.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Constraint Reasons</title>

      <para>When a constraint fails, it is often useful to generate a report
      that describes the reason for the failure.</para>

      <para>A reason can be added to a constraint via the reason editor
      (scroll down to view it). Add an XOCL expression that generates an
      appropriate string report. For example, the following report generates a
      reason for the failure of the SamePortType constraint:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/reasonexample.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Parse Errors</title>

      <para>When entering code into the bodies of constraints, operations,
      etc. parse errors will displayed if an attempt is made to commit code
      that does not parse.</para>

      <para>For example, try adding an additional "." to the SamePortType
      expression. A parse error will be displayed indicating where the parser
      reached before it failed.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/parseerror.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>In this case, the code box will remain pink until the mistake is
      removed, or, the right click &gt; Cancel Changes option is chosen. This
      will return the code box to its previous (valid) state.</para>

      <para>Many other constraints can be added to the model. As an example,
      the following constraint on ComponentModel ensures that no two
      components can have the same name:</para>

      <title>Checking Snapshots</title>

      <para>Objects in a snapshot can be checked against their constraints in
      the following ways:</para>

      <para>Via the Object menu in the browser:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Right click on the object, select Invoke Operation ..., then
          choose checkConstraints()</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Via the Snapshot menu in the browser or diagram:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Right click on the snapshot icon in the browser, or the
          background of the snapshot diagram, and select Check Constraints.
          This will check the constraints on all the objects in the snapshot.
          Note, a choice of whether to check only the objects in the diagram,
          or all the objects in the snapshot (if using a partial view) can be
          made at this point.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Via the Console:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Invoke the checkConstraints() operation on the relevant
          object. The details of the ConstraintReport can be edited by
          appending .edit() to checkConstraints().</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Here is the constraint checker being invoked via the snapshot
      diagram:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/checkingasnapshot.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The result of checking an object or snapshot is to display a
      <emphasis>ConstraintReport</emphasis>: a tree of object constraint
      reports.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Interpreting the results</title>

        <para>A ConstraintReport is displayed as a tree containing the result
        of each constraint check:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/constraintreport.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>In this example, every object has passed its constraints.</para>

        <para>Let's change the snapshot so that it fails a constraint, for
        example by setting the type of one of the ports to be different from a
        port it is connected to. Do this by editing the value of type in the
        object. Running the constraint checker produces the following:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/failedconstraint.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>In this case, the snapshot fails the constraint check, and if we
        expand it to see why, it is because the types don't match.
        Furthermore, because we added a Constraint Reason when we wrote the
        constraint, it has printed out some helpful diagnostics.</para>

        <para>The failed constraint can be edited by double clicking on
        it.</para>

    <title>Adding Queries</title>

    <para>Queries are <emphasis role="bold">operations</emphasis> that do not
    change the state of the model. They are a very useful means of navigating
    around a model, filtering and collecting information about its
    properties.</para>

    <para>Operations can be added to classes in a similar way to adding
    constraints and queries.</para>

    <para>To add an operation, right click on a class in the class diagram or
    in the browser and choose Add Element&gt;Operation. A new operation will
    be added to the browser under the class. Click on it to show the operation
    editor.</para>

    <para>You should not change the "@Operation" and "end" parts of the

    <title>Running Operations</title>

     Operations and queries can be run in a number of different of ways in XMF-Mosaic. The following describes the most common ways. 

    <section>
      <title>Running Operations on Snapshots</title>

      <para>Operations and queries can be run on objects in a snapshot.</para>

      <para>Right click on the object in the browser and select Invoke
      Operation. This will display the operations that can be invoked on the
      object. Because all classes inherit from Object, this list will include
      all operations that have been defined for an Object. In addition,
      operations on the class will be displayed.</para>

      <para>Only operations with zero parameters are displayed in this list
      (operations that require parameters should be accessed via the console
      or via the expression evaluator - see later).</para>

      <para>As an example, we can call the dontMatch() query via Invoke
      Operation.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/invokinganobjectoperation.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The result of running the operation will be displayed in the
      property editor.</para>

      <para>Note that operations are immediately available via the menu once
      they have been successfully committed.</para>

      <para>In the case of operations with parameters, we must be able to pass
      the parameters into the operation in order to call it. This can be
      achieved using the console (see later). However, there is menu based
      support for this as follows:</para>

      <para>First assign any objects that will be used as parameter values to
      global variables. To do this right click on the object in a property
      editor and then select Assign To Global Variable. Give the object a
      name, in this case we are assigning p to a Port.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/assigninglobal.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Next, select the object that the operation is to be run on, and
      select right click &gt; Evaluate Expression.</para>

      <para>A simple expression editor will appear. Type the operation in,
      followed by an edit() operation to show the results. Press OK to run the
      operation.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/evaluateexp.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>

     
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Operations</title>

    <para>In addition to writing queries, operations also enable instances of
    models to be manipulated (just as you would manipulate data in a
    programming language). XOCL provides a number of imperative (programming
    style) features for the purpose of writing operations. These include
    standard "for", "while", and "case" constructs among others. Full details
    can be found in part 3 of the Bluebook.</para>

    <para>As an example, the following operation sets the name of a Port to be
    the value passed by the parameter of the operation.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/operationexample.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Right click &gt; Commit Changes to update the model with the new
    operation. Edit self to change the operation name.</para>

    <para>Again, if the code is not syntactically correct a parse error will
    be raised.</para>

    <para>Operations can make use of queries to access properties of a model
    before they manipulate them. For example, the following operation uses a
    query to calculate all the connections that target the port, p, and then
    sets the source port names to tbe the same as p's name:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/opqueryexample.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <section>
      <title>Exercises</title>

      <para>Try adding the following operations to the domain model:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>An operation on the class Component that sets its owner to be
          a passed ComponentModel.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>An operation on the class Component that sets the name of the
          Component to be a passed String.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Adding Getters and Setters</title>

    <para>Getter and Setter operations for specific attributes can be
    conveniently added to a class. Right click on the attribute (in the
    diagram or browser) and select Create Getter or Creat Setter.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/creatingasetter.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Creating a Setter will add operations for adding new instances to
    the attribute (as shown below), while adding a Getter will add an
    operation to query the value of an attribute.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/examplesetter.jpg" />
      </imageobject>

    <section>
      <title>Exercises</title>

      <para>Create a Setter for the attribute "components" of the class
      ComponentModel.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Adding Constructors</title>

    <para>Constructors are operations on classes which are called when
    creating a new instance of the class.</para>

    <para>Note by default all classes have the empty constructor and this need
    not be defined.</para>

    <para>To add a constructor right click on a class in the class diagram or
    in the browser and choose New&gt;Constructor. A new constructor will be
    added to the browser under the class. Click on it to show the constructor
    editor.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/addingaconstructor.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Parameters can be added to a constructor. To do this, add the name
    of each parameter in the desired order within the comma separated sequence
    of names. For example, the following constructor for a Port has 'name' and
    'type' as its parameters.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/constructorwithparam.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Note each name should correspond to a name of an attribute of the
    class that is to be instantiated when the constructor is called.</para>

    <para>Any number of constructors may be defined for a class. This enables
    different tasks to be performed per type of instantiation depending on the
    number of parameters that are passed.</para>

    <para>In addition to supporting simple parameter passing, XOCL code can be
    entered in the body of a constructor to perform a specific task when the
    constructor is called.</para>

    <para>Here is an example of an action that sets the name of a Port to be
    uppercase when it is created.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/constructorwithaction.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>After this action is performed, an action to return the object
    (self) is called. If this were not added the constructor would only return
    the value of self.name.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Exercises</title>

      <para>Try adding a constructor for a Component takes its name as a
      parameter.</para>

    <title>Interacting with Models using the Console</title>

    <para>Once a model has been built, it is useful to validate that it is
    accurate. One way to do this is by interacting with the model via the
    console. The console is an interpreter for evaluating XOCL
    expressions.</para>

    <para>Switch to the console by clicking on the Console View tab on
    property editor. XOCL expressions can be entered that evaluate to create
    instances of models, modify them and invoke operations on them.</para>

    <para>For example, the following shows the use of the console to interact
    with and test the Components model:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/console.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Here is what is happening:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The ?i command is used to import the Components package so that
        all its contents are visible. Note, otherwise we would have to give
        the full path names to each element, e.g.
        Components::Component.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A is the result of creating an instance of the class
        ComponentModel In XOCL, the use of brackets after a class name denotes
        the invocation of a constructor. Note, we will have needed to create a
        constructor for Component beforehand.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The result of navigating down the components of A is evaluated.
        Because no components have been added to A it returns the empty set

      <title>Other Console Hints and Tips</title>

      <para>The console is a very flexible tool for interacting with models.
      The following are some examples.</para>

      <para>Basic variable values can be created simply by typing them into
      the console. In addition, the console is a useful place to test out XOCL
      operations and expressions.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/basicvalueconsoleops.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>All values can be assigned to variables.</para>

      <para>The console is also useful for creating instances of classes. As
      described in the XOCL manual, there are two ways that instances of
      classes can be created in XOCL. The first is to use a constructor as
      described above. The second approach is to use a <emphasis>pattern
      constructor</emphasis>. The following uses a pattern constructor to
      create an instance of a component and match its name to the string
      literal "Navigation". The advantage of a pattern constructor is that it
      allows values to be explicitly assigned to local variables.</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>When using the console, the up and down cursor keys can be used to
      move between previous commands.</para>

      <para>The console provides a number of "hot keys". These can be accessed
      by typing ?h (no semi-colon is required).</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/hotkeys.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Any operation running in the console can be interupted by pressing
      the escape key.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Editing Values via the Console</title>

      <para>At any point we can edit/view the properties of an object in a
      property editor by running edit() against it. For example, let’s edit
      the ComponentModel instance which was assigned to the variable A
      (above):</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/consolepropertyedit.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>A collection editor will be displayed containing the
      instance.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/consolecomponentedit.jpg" />

      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Using Global Variables</title>

      <para>Global variables can be assigned to elements which can then be
      used in the console. For example, edit the properties of a Port object,
      then select right click &gt; Assign to Global Variable. The tool will
      prompt for a global variable name for the object.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/portassigntoglobal.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The port object is then available in the console:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/portconsoleedit.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Error Reports</title>

      <para>If errors occur when building the model, they will be shown as an
      ErrorReport.</para>

      <para>Try modifying addToComponents() so that it attempts to update an
      invalid slot, e.g. change “components” to “component”.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/errorexample.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Error reports can be expanded to show the sequence of calls that
      resulted in the error. These go from the most specific call right down
      to the engine calls that handled the error.</para>

    <title>Using Snapshots</title>

    <section>
      <title>Generating Snapshots from the Console</title>

      <para>Snapshots can also be generated from an object by running
      toSnapshot() followed by showDiagram() on the object. Select TotalView
      (a partial view will by default not be populated with objects). For
      example, running A.toSnapshot().showDiagram() in the console produces
      the following snapshot:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/generatedsnapshot.jpg" />

    <title>Adding Package Operations</title>

    <para>In XMF-Mosaic, packages have class like features. They can have
    operations and attributes, can be instantiated and inherit from other
    packages.</para>

    <para>Package operations in particular are useful for capturing global
    operations that apply across an entire model.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Adding and Running Package Operations</title>

      <para>To add an operation to a package, right click New &gt; Operation.
      Edit the operation in the browser. The following operation creates an
      instance of a ComponentModel and populates it with values.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/packageop.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The operation can be invoked via the console using the special
      package operation invocation syntax (Package::Op()). The result of
      runnning the operation can be edited by adding .edit() after the
      operation call.</para>

    <title>Next Steps</title>

    <para>Although more can be added, most of the basic concepts in the domain
    have been captured. In the remainder of this document, different ways of
    manipulating models of languages are described and illustrated through
    this example.</para>
