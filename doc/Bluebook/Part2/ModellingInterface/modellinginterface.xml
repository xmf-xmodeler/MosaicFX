<chapter>
  <title>Working with the Modelling Interface</title>

  <para>The previous chapter showed how models can be constructed in
  XMF-Mosaic. This chapter gives some general hints and tips for getting the
  most from the modelling interface.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Windows</title>

    <section>
      <title>Displaying Multiple Diagrams and Windows</title>

      <para>Any number of diagram windows can be displayed at once by dragging
      a diagram tab to one of the edges of another diagram. For example, a
      snapshot diagram can be placed next to a class diagram:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/splitdiagram.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Diagrams can be tiled both horizontally and vertically.</para>

      <para>Browser and property editors can be split in exactly the same way.
      For example, the Root browser and a Project browser can be split:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/splitbrowser.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>It is also possible to move windows outside of XMF-Mosaic. Both
      the browser and console can be moved in this way.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/ripping.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Preferences</title>

    <para>Many different preferences can be set for different aspects of
    XMF-Mosaic, including the diagram editor, console and text editors.
    Preferences can be changed via the Window &gt; Preferences menu and are
    automatically loaded at boot. Preferences can also be imported and
    exported.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/preferences.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Property Editor</title>

    <para>Property editors provide facilities for managing property histories.
    Everytime a new propery is displayed, the old property is overwritten in
    the in the property editor window. However, the old property editor can
    still be viewed by looking at its history. For instance, if we edit the
    class Port followed by the class Component, the properties of the Airport
    will be the last to be displayed in the property editor. To view the
    history right, click on the history icon in the top right hand of the
    property editor. Select the propery to view: We can also flip backwards
    and forwards between histories using the left and right arrow buttons
    (like a browser).</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/history.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>If you don't want a property to be overwritten, it can be locked by
    clicking on the padlock icon in the top right hand of the property editor
    window:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="Images/lockedpropertyeditor.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Clicking on the eraser icon clears the history.</para>
