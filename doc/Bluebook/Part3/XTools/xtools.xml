    <para>The XTools package is used to construct and deploy tools. An Xtool
    is some data together with interfaces for both user and inter-tool
    interaction. Since all aspects of tools are modeled, Xtools can be
    analysed, transformed and deployed. This document describes the XTools
    approach to tool definition and is a reference manual for Xtool definition
    mechanisms.</para>

    <title>The XTools Architecture</title>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>An Xtool is an instance of a domain model together with an exposed
      interface for constructing and manipulating the instance. An Xtool is
      modelled and is expressed in an XTools modelling language. The language
      hides away much of the implementation detail that is necessary to
      construct tools and ensures that multiple tools over a variety of domain
      models have a consistent look and feel. In addition, since an Xtool is
      modelled, it can be mechanically processed. In particular an Xtool can
      be transformed into different formats, for example exporting the
      definition as XML or as programming language source code.</para>

      <para>Xtools manage changes in domain model instances by raising and
      handling events. Each Xtool contains a monitor for all the events that
      can be raised on the user interface and by external agents that change
      the domain model instance. By raising and handling events, multiple
      Xtools can be seamlessly composed without having to know anything about
      each other.</para>

      <para>All Xtools conform to a basic architecture that ensures consistent
      look and feel across all generated tools and allows Xtools to work
      together to form tool federations. This section describes the components
      of the architecture.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Tool Component</title>

      <para>The basic features of an Xtool are defined in the package
      Clients::Tools::Basic:</para>

      </mediaobject>

      <para>A tool consists of:</para>

      <para>A tool type that defines how the tool’s user interface should be
      constructed and managed. A tool type is like a class in that a single
      tool type can be the type of many tools. A tool type defines named
      attributes of the tool; the value of each attribute depends on the type
      of tool we are constructing: for example, a diagram tool can have text
      attributes and image attributes whereas a form tool can have tree
      attributes and text box attributes. The tool type also defines the
      events that are generated when the user interacts with the interface.
      For example, if the tool type defines a text field called name then an
      event name_Changed will be raised whenever the user types in the text
      field.</para>

      <para>An element manager that defines how the tool responds to events.
      Events are generated either by user interaction with the interface or by
      modifications to the underlying element managed by the tool. An element
      manager contains a collection of event handlers.</para>

      <para>A domain element that is managed by the tool. Change events from
      the user interface cause the element manager to modify the managed
      element. Change events from the managed element cause the element
      manager to modify the user interface associated with the tool.</para>

      <para>Note that the user interface is not a prescribed part of a tool
      definition since the details of the user interface will depend on the
      type of tool.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Tool Event</title>

      <para>Tool execution occurs in the form of events. An event occurs due
      to a change arising in the user interface (such as a diagram edit); or
      due to a change in the element managed by the tool. Events are handled
      by a tool’s element manager. The element manager contains a collection
      of event handlers; each handler listens for events of a particular type.
      The event handler runs some code that handles the event when it occurs.
      Typically the code propagates a change from the user interface to the
      managed element and vice versa. The following diagram shows how events
      are handled when a change occurs to a user interface:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/image006.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The user performs a modification to the interface via the mouse.
      This causes a state change in the interface object which is detected by
      a monitor and translated into an event of the appropriate type. The
      event is sent from the interface to the tool and then to the element
      manager. The element manager selects an event handler by matching
      against the type of the event. When a suitable event handler has been
      selected, it is executed. The body of the event handler performs
      appropriate updates to the managed element.</para>

      <para>Conversely, the following diagram shows how changes to the managed
      element update the user interface. An external agent changes the managed
      element. If changes to the managed element are being monitored by the
      tool (sometimes this is not required) then the changes gives rise to an
      event in the tool which, like changes to the user interface, give rise
      to an event in the element manager. An appropriate handler is selected
      which uses lookup mechanisms in the element manager to associate the
      changed element with a user interface component; the component is then
      updated.</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The following model shows the basic architecture of the XTools
      event mechanism:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/image010.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>An event manager is a name space that defines event handlers. Each
      event handler has an operation that implements the code for handling the
      event. An event handler has a pattern that matches against the type of
      the event that the handler monitors. An element manager inherits
      handlers from its parents.</para>

      <para>Creation events are typically propagated from user interface to
      managed element and vice versa. Once created, elements must be managed
      so that subsequent modification events can be propagated. An element
      manager has a table that is used to record associations between user
      interface elements and managed elements when they are created.
      Subsequent modification events can then look up the modified element in
      the table and propagate the change.</para>

      <para>XTools provides a range of tool types. Each tool type provides a
      different collection of events. All XTool events inherit from the basic
      Event class that requires the event to record the tool that raised the
      event. The tool is particularly useful when implementing event handlers
      since it provides access to the managed element and the element manager
      with its table of associations.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Tool Definition</title>

      <para>XTools provides a number of technologies for tool definition. The
      essential representation is using the XTools textual language to
      construct the tool components. The XTools classes define a number of
      grammars that must be imported using parserImport in order to use the
      textual format. The essential components of a tool definition are the
      tool type and the element manager. If the tool is to be defined in a
      single file then the following XMF code skeleton shows the key
      definitions:<programlisting>parserImport Tools::DiagramTools::Types;
parserImport Tools::Events;

context MyPackage

@Package NewTool

  @ToolType NewToolType

     // Type component definitions...

  end

  @ElementManager NewToolManager

    @EventHandler EventName()

      // Handler body...
    
    end

     // Event handler definitions...

  end

end</programlisting></para>

      <para>The tool type, element manager and event handlers need not be
      defined inside their container’s textual definition. You may use context
      definitions to define these elements in isolation, for example:</para>

      <para><programlisting>context MyPackage

  @ToolType NewTool

    // Type component definitions...

  end

context MyPackage

  @ElementManager NewToolManager

  end

context MyPackage::NewToolManager

  @EventHandler EventName()

    // Handler body...

  end
</programlisting>Different context definitions may exist in different files
      (probably composed using a manifest). Of course, definitions must exist
      before they can be referenced, in the build order.</para>

      <para>Once the tool type and the element manager have been defined a new
      tool is created by instantiating the appropriate XTools tool class. For
      example, if we are defining an diagram tool then we create an instance
      of the tool class Tools::DiagramTools::Structure::Tool:<programlisting>import Tools::DiagramTools::Structure;
import MyPackage::NewTool;

...

let tool = Tool(toolName,NewToolType,NewToolManager,element)
in tool.showDiagram()
end

...</programlisting></para>

      <para>A tool constructor takes four arguments: the name of the tool, the
      tool type, the tool manager and the managed element. The managed element
      can be any value: it is up to the event handlers to interpret this value
      appropriately. It is likely that new types of tool (based on diagram or
      form tools) will be required. It is easy to define your own extensions
      to these types of tool by sub-classing the appropriate Tool
      class.</para>

      <para>Once a tool has been created, it is displayed and ready for use
      after a call of showDiagram. This call will create the user interface
      for the tool and display it. Subsequent calls to showDiagram will switch
      the tool focus back to this tool.</para>

      <title>Tool Deployment</title>

      <para>Tools can only be deployed into XMF-Mosaic in version 1.0 of
      XTools.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Diagram Tools</title>

    <para>XTools supports a number of tool types. Diagram tools manage
    elements based on diagram editors. A diagram consists of nodes and edges
    with various display elements attached to the diagram components. A user
    interacts with the diagram by creating nodes and edges and editing the
    display elements. Each interaction gives rise to an event that is handled
    by the diagram tool’s element manager. This section defines the features
    of diagram tools and provides a number of examples to show you how to go
    about creating and deploying a rich collection of domain specific
    tools.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>A diagram tool extends the basic notion of an Xtool with a
      diagram. XMF-Mosaic provides a model of diagrams in Clients::Diagrams;
      this is the basis for diagram tools.</para>

      <para>Typically you will define a domain model and then decide how you
      want to construct elements of the model and interact with them. This
      design is the basis for a domain specific user interface (you may have
      more than one for any given domain model). The user interface is defined
      as an Xtool in terms of a diagram type and an element manager.</para>

      <para>The following model shows a simple extension of basic XTools Tool
      to support diagrams:</para>

    <section>
      <title>Diagram Tool Components</title>

      <para>A diagram tool manages a diagram. The diagram is modelled and
      consists of a graph of nodes and edges. Each node contains a collection
      of display elements that describe how the node is to be rendered. A node
      has a number of ports that are used as places on the node to connect
      edges. A node without any ports cannot be connected via edges (but may
      be useful as a diagram element nonetheless).</para>

      <para>An edge has a source and target port, has a line style, end arrows
      and a number of labels. The line style defines how the edge will be
      drawn (for example a dashed line). The end arrows defined the
      decoration, if any, that occurs on either end of the edge (for example
      an arrow head or a diamond). The labels of an edge are text fields that
      are attached to one of the start, end or middle of the edge. Labels may
      be readonly in which case they cannot be modified.</para>

      <para>Node display elements may be one of the following:</para>

      <para><itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Boxes. A box acts as a container of display elements. The
            edges of a box may be hidden or drawn. Boxes are useful when
            managing a collection of sub-elements on a node.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Ellipse. An ellipse has a outline that may be hidden.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Image. An image is a bitmap that is defined in an external
            file.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Text. A text field may be readonly.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>All display elements have a position relative to (0,0)
      which is the top left hand corner of its container (y increases down the
      screen). You do not have to worry about positions because XTools
      provides layout managers that deal with all the hard work of placing
      display elements.</para>

      <para>All display elements have a width and height. In most cases these
      values are handled by the layout manager so you don’t have to worry
      about positioning or size, you can focus on what the information is
      rather than how it is presented.</para>

      <para>Both nodes and node display elements may be associated with ports.
      A port is a place on a node that acts as a receptor for edge connection.
      Whilst ports have position and size, associating a port with a diagram
      element in XTools automatically arranges for the port to be at the same
      location and size as the associated element. Typically you will
      associate a port with each node type you define. The node can therefore
      act as the source or target of an edge and XTools manages the resizing
      of the ports automatically when the node changes shape. Occasionally you
      may have a strange shaped node where various parts of the node can be
      connected differently; in this case you will associate ports with node
      display components.</para>

      <para>The following model provides an overview of diagrams used in
      diagram tools. As noted above, you probably will not need to know about
      the detail of this model, just acquaint yourself with the logical
      relationships between the classes:</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Nodes and Edges</title>

      <para>A diagram consists of nodes and edges. For example, the diagram
      shown in the previous section consists of nodes of type ClassNode and
      edges of types InheritanceEdge and AttributeEdge. When defining a domain
      specific language editor, you need to list the node and edge types that
      you wish to display on the diagram. These may correspond directly to the
      classes in your domain model and the associations between them (node and
      edge types respectively). Of course the relationship between model
      classes and diagram types need not be so direct. This section describes
      how you define node and edge types in the XTools textual
      language.</para>

      <para>A node type has the following format:<programlisting>@NodeType name(properties) extends parents
  display elements
  menu
end
</programlisting></para>

      <para>A node type has a name followed by a collection of comma separated
      properties in parentheses. Optionally you may define that a node type is
      an extension of a comma separated list of node type names. This allows
      node type hierarchies to be constructed and can be important when
      defining edge types as described below.</para>

      <para>Display elements are defined next followed by the menu for the
      node type. A node type may have the following properties:</para>

      <para>HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL or OVERLAY layout directives for the display
      elements. This directive defines how the contained display elements will
      be arranged when a node of this type is created. These are defined in
      more detail in the section on layout later in this document.</para>

      <para>hasport. This property defines that each instance of this node
      type has a port associated with the entire node. The port will
      automatically be resized when the node is resized.</para>

      <para>An edge type has the following format:<programlisting>@EdgeType name source -&gt; target optSource optTarget optStyle
  labels
  menu
end</programlisting></para>

      <para>An edge type has a name followed by the name of the source and
      target node types. An edge of the defined type may only be added to a
      diagram between nodes of the declared types. Note that node types are
      arranged in an inheritance hierarchy so that edge instances may be drawn
      between any sub-types of the declared source and target.</para>

      <para>The source and target arrows are optional. If they are specified
      then they must both be specified and must be an integer that specifies
      the display element at the appropriate end. The integer values are as
      follows: noArrow, arrow, blackDiamond, whiteDiamond, blackArrow,
      whiteArrow. The optional style defines the way in which the edge will be
      drawn. The values are as follows: solidLine, dashLine, dottedLine,
      dashDottedLine, dashDotDotLine.</para>

      <para>A label has the following format:<programlisting>@Label name(position,dx,dy) string end</programlisting></para>

      <para>A label has a name. The name is used to navigate to the label in
      an instance of the enclosing edge type. The position of the label
      defines where it will be drawn relative to the edge. The position may be
      start, end or middle. The dx and dy values are integers that specify
      co-ordinates relative to the position of the label. The initial text of
      the label is given as a string in the body of the label type
      definition.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Toolbar</title>

      <para>A toolbar is drawn at the left hand side of a diagram tool and
      contains tool groups and buttons. Groups are named collections of
      buttons. A toolbar is used to create instances of node and edge types.
      The following model shows the structure of toolbars:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/image022.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The textual language for defining tool groups is as
      follows:<programlisting>@ToolBar
  groups 
end</programlisting></para>

      <para>Each group is defined as follows:<programlisting>@ToolGroup name
  buttons
end</programlisting></para>

      <para>The name of the group appears in the tool bar. Each button is
      defined as follows:<programlisting>@ToolButton name optIsEdge
  icon = filename
end</programlisting></para>

      <para>The name of the button defines the text that appears on the
      diagram. The name of the button should be the name of a node type or an
      edge type. If it is the name of a node type then it defines a node
      creation button and will not contain isEdge. If it is an edge creation
      button then it must contain isEdge. The icon for the button is specified
      by giving the file containing the bitmap as a string.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Menus</title>

      <para>Menus may be added to a large number of diagram tool elements. A
      menu definition specifies the functionality that is associated with the
      diagram element. When the element is selected on the diagram using a
      mouse right click, the menu appears offering menu actions. Menus can be
      defined for diagram tool types, node types, display types and edge
      types. The following model shows the structure of a menu:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/image027.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>A menu is specified as follows:<programlisting>@Menu
  items 
end</programlisting></para>

      <para>A menu item is either a named sequence of menu items or a single
      menu action. A sequence of menu items produces a sub-menu and is used to
      group related menu actions. A menu action has an operation that is used
      to implement the action when it is selected.<programlisting>@MenuItems name
  items 
end</programlisting></para>

      <para>The body of a menu action is just XOCL code:<programlisting>@MenuAction name
  body
end</programlisting></para>

      <para>A menu is displayed when you right click on an instance of the
      containing element type. You may then select one of the actions
      (possibly by navigating down sub-menus). The body of the selected action
      is performed. Within the body you may refer to the containing instance
      as self, and refer to the containing tool as tool. The action that is
      being performed can be referred to as action (this is useful in the rare
      circumstance that you want to remove the action from the menu).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Diagram Events</title>

      <para>You perform operations on a diagram tool using the mouse. You may
      add a new node or re-attach an edge. When these changes take place, an
      event of an appropriate type is raised in the containing Xtool. The
      event contains references to the tool and to any elements that are
      involved in the diagram operation.</para>

      <para>Events are raised and then handled by the event handlers defined
      by the tool’s element manager. A handler is selected by calculating the
      event’s raised name. Generally this name is composed of a path
      identifying the diagram component that changes and the type of the
      event. The path is a sequence of attribute names starting with the name
      of the type of the root diagram element (for example a node or edge) .
      For example, if we have the following node type:</para>

      <para>When the text is modified on the diagram, the path component of
      the raised name is N_B_T and the event type (as we see below) is
      _Changed, therefore the raised name is N_B_T_Changed. The raised name is
      the name used in the event handler that will be used to handle the
      event.</para>

      <para>Diagram events fall into one of three general categories:</para>

      <para>Change events. These occur when an existing diagram element is
      modified, for example by editing some text or by re-attaching an edge
      end. These also occur when an existing container is modified by adding
      or removing a new element.</para>

      <para>Creation events. These occur when a new node or edge is
      created.</para>

      <para>Deletion events. These occur when a node or edge is
      removed.</para>

      <para>The following model shows the various types of change
      event:</para>

      <para>The rest of this section describes each of the diagram event types
      and how their raised name is calculated.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>AttributeChanged. This event is raised when text is modified.
          The changed text element is the value of the event, the node
          containing the display element is the root of the event. The
          attribute value before and after the change is supplied via old and
          new in the event. The raised name is the path followed by
          _Changed.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>EdgeAttributeChanged. The same as AttributeChanged except that
          the text on an edge label is modified.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>AttributeValueAdded. When a container has a *-type (see later
          in the document), new instances of the *-ed type can be added. When
          a new instance is added this event is raised. The path identifies
          the attribute that has been added and the value of the event is the
          new display element. The raised name is the path followed by
          _Added.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>SourceChanged. When the source of an edge is moved from one
          node to another this event is raised. The source before and after
          the change is recorded in the old and new of the event. The raised
          name is the type of the modified edge followed by
          _Source_Changed.</para>

      <title>An Example Domain Specific XTool</title>

      <para>This section provides a complete example of an Xtool. The tool
      manages a graph where the nodes and edges are labelled with text. The
      graph is updated by events occurring on a diagram interface and the
      diagram is updated by events occurring to the graph. The example is
      deliberately simple, but contains examples of most Xtool definition
      features.</para>

      <section>
        <title>A Domain Model</title>

        <para>The first step in defining a DSL-tool is to define the domain
        model and its semantics. An Xtool exposes an interface over the domain
        model to the user and other tools. Our example domain model is one
        that it provided as standard with XMF-Mosaic: Graphs. The interface
        that we expose to the user is the creation and deletion of graph nodes
        and edges. In addition we label the nodes and edges with strings and
        expose the setData operations via the diagram tool. The following
        model shows the domain model:</para>

        <mediaobject>

        </mediaobject>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Design of the User Interface</title>

        <para>Once we have defined the domain model and chosen the interface
        we want to expose, the next step is to informally sketch out the look
        and feel of the Xtool. In this case we will define a diagram tool to
        expose the chosen interface. The creation operations will be exposed
        via toolbar operations, node and edge deletion will be exposed via
        menu operations on the respective diagram elements. Data modification
        will be exposed via text modification on the diagram labels and edge
        source and target changes will be exposed by retargeting the edges on
        the diagram. The following screenshot shows an example usage of the
        tool we want to build:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image039.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>The left hand part of the tool shows a tool bar with a single
        tool group called Operations with a node creation button Node and an
        edge creation button Edge. The diagram canvas shows a graph diagram
        consisting of nodes (created by selecting the Node button and then
        clicking on the canvas) and edges (created by selecting the Edge
        button and linking two nodes). Each node and edge has a label that can
        be edited by selecting and modifying the text.</para>

        <para>When we create and edit a graph diagram an underlying element is
        created and modified. In this case we will create and modify a graph
        from the package Graphs. This makes the example easy because the
        element and the diagram are in one-to-one correspondence. The graph
        consists of nodes and edges whose data components are the labels on
        the diagram. The following property editor shows the underlying graph
        element after constructing the diagram shown above:</para>

        <para>The rest of this section provides a step-by-step analysis of the
        graph editing tool definition.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Defining the Tool Type</title>

        <para>The first step is to define the tool type. The tool type defines
        the nodes types, the edge types and the tool bar type. Each node and
        edge type defines named attributes. Node types have named attributes
        that are display elements; each display element contributes to how a
        node is drawn and to the events raised when a node is created and
        modified. Edge types have named attributes for the labels on the edge.
        Node, edge and display types can have menu types. The following tool
        snapshot shows the source code for the graph editor tool; the code
        includes comments that describe each of the type components:</para>

      <section>
        <title>Defining the Element Manager</title>

        <para>Once the tool type has been defined it is possible to define the
        element manager for the tool. The element manager defines an event
        handler for each of the events that the tool must handle. Events are
        raised in two ways: either by modifications to the diagram (such as
        creating a new node or editing a label); or, by modifying the
        underlying data element that the tool is managing (such as adding a
        node to the graph managed by the graph editor). In the case of events
        raised by the data element, event handlers are only necessary of the
        tool is observing the data element. In some cases a tool is used to
        construct the underlying data element that is then exported or
        exclusively manipulated by the tool. In this case the tool is in full
        control of the underlying element and does not need to observe it for
        externally generated changes. Our graph editor will observe the
        underlying graph in order for the example to cover as many tool
        definition issues as possible.</para>

        <para>An element manager must define a creation event handler for each
        diagram node and edge type. A creation event is raised whenever a new
        node or edge is created on the diagram. An event handler has a name
        that corresponds to the event that it is designed to handle. The event
        handler has an argument list (which will be empty for the purposes of
        this example) and a body. The body is supplied with the raised event
        as the value of the variable event. The state of the event is accessed
        using a collection of accessor operations; the names of the operations
        correspond to the attributes of the particular event type. All events
        have an operation tool() that returns the tool that raised the
        event.</para>

        <para>The event handler body may also reference two special
        operations: register and find. Register is used to associate a key
        with a value in the element handler table. Typically this is used to
        as associate tool elements with domain elements so that when events
        are raised, the handlers can map from a tool element to the
        appropriate domain element and vice versa. The graph editor example
        contains many examples of the use of these operations.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Handling Diagram Events</title>

        <para>In the case of a node creation event, the new tool node is the
        value of node(). The following tool snapshot shows the source code for
        the node creation handler:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image047.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Line 49 creates a new graph node corresponding to the tool node
        whose creation raised the event. Once created, the two nodes are
        associated using the register operation in lines 50 and 51.
        Registration is necessary so that modifications to either node can map
        to, and therefore modify, the other node. Finally, the domain element
        is modified by adding the new node to the graph.</para>

        <para>A new edge raises an event that is handled by the following
        definition:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image049.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>An edge creation event contains the new edge and its source and
        target nodes. Since the source and target nodes must have been created
        previously, they must have been registered by a node creation event
        handler. Therefore, the find operation can be used in line 59 to map
        from tool nodes to graph nodes when creating a graph edge. Once
        created, the edges are registered against one another in lines 60 and
        61. The domain element is modified in line 62.</para>

        <para>The tool type for a graph editor allows the nodes and edges to
        be removed via a menu action. When a tool element is deleted, an
        appropriate event is raised. The following handlers deal with node and
        edge deletion:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image051.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>The find operation is used to map from the tool node to the
        graph node in lines 68 and 73. The graph elements are then removed
        from the graph.</para>

        <para>The tool type for a graph editor specifies that a node and an
        edge both have labels. In the case of a node, the label is defined as
        a text attribute named label. Since we did not specify that these are
        read only, they can be modified on the diagram. When modifications
        take place, an appropriate event is raised.</para>

        <para>In both cases the diagram components are tool attributes named
        label. Events that are raised in response to modifications to
        contained tool elements (such as a text component of a node or an edge
        label) have names that are based on the path from the root container
        of the element. For example, a modification to a node label gives rise
        to an event named Node_label_Changed where the path from the root
        container to the modified element is Node_label. This rule applies no
        matter how deeply nested the modified element is.</para>

        <para>The handlers for label modifications are given below.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image053.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>A node change event has an operation root() that returns the
        root container of the modified element. This is used in line 78 to
        find the graph node to modify. A change event also contains a value()
        operation that returns the modified tool element; this operation is
        not required for this example. A change event returns the value before
        the change as old() and the value after the change as new(). Line79
        changes the data on the graph node to be the modified label
        text.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>This concludes the event handlers for events arising as a result
        of changes to the diagram.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Handling Managed Element Events</title>

        <para>When a node is added to the graph we must modify the diagram on
        the tool to keep it in sync. Each event handler for managed element
        modifications has a name consisting of the type of the changed
        element, the word Object the name of the slot that is modified and the
        word Changed. The event has operations to access to the new and old
        values of the slot.</para>

        <para>The following handler deals with changes to the nodes of the
        graph:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image057.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>When designing event handlers for Xtools that process events
        from both the user interface and the managed element it is necessary
        to decide on a policy for preventing the same change being propagated
        back and forth. Consider the case of adding a new node on the diagram.
        This raises a New_Node event causing the managed graph to be updated
        with a new node. When this occurs, a Graph_Object_nodes_Added event is
        raised; since this event may have been caused by some external agent
        adding a new node to the graph, a reasonable implementation for this
        handler is to modify the diagram interface to add a new node. If we do
        this, we cause an infinite ping-pong between the user interface and
        the managed element.</para>

        <para>To address this issue it is sensible to take each pair of
        dependent handlers and to ensure that events bottom out. This can be
        achieved by preventing events occurring in one of the handlers and by
        checking that actions have not already occurred as shown above in
        lines 108 and 110. When a new node is added to the managed graph in
        the handler for New_Node, a Graph_Object_nodes_Added event is raised;
        when this event is handled no New_Node event is raised (although the
        diagram will be updated as we will see). This ensures that diagram
        changes update the graph and graph changes update the diagram but that
        this does not lead to infinite regress. Note that it is possible to
        suppress events in both handlers, but this is not necessary; if you do
        suppress events in both then it is not necessary to include a
        registration check as in line 110 since neither handler will cause the
        other to be invoked.</para>

        <para>Line 112 shows the creation of a new instance of the diagram
        node type Node. Xtools allow new node types to be instantiated at a
        given position on the diagram using the newNode operation. Once the
        new node is created, it is registered in lines 113 and 114. The label
        on the new node is updated to contain the graph node label in line
        116.</para>

        <para>The following shows how the removal of nodes from the managed
        graph is handled:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image059.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>The nodes that have been removed are supplied as the old part of
        the event. We should only remove nodes if they are currently
        registered (line 127). All display elements implement a delete
        operation (line 129) that removes the element from the diagram (and
        fires events if they are enabled). Finally the elements are
        deregistered from the tool (lines 130 and 131).</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image061.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>When an edge is added to the graph we must create an edge on the
        diagram. Diagram edges are attached to ports that are contained in
        nodes. A node may have more than one port (some may be associated with
        display components of the node), but providing that the node has at
        least one port, a port is produced by calling the port operation of
        the diagram node (lines 143 and 144).</para>

        <para>A diagram tool provides a newEdge operation that draws a new
        edge between ports on the diagram (line 145). In order to register
        when the ends of an edge change we must observe the edge (line 148).
        The text in labels on edges are changed using the textChanged
        operation (line 149).</para>

        <para>When an edge is removed from a graph that is monitored by a
        tool, the following event is raised. The handler, deletes the diagram
        element and deregisters the appropriate elements:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image063.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>When the data on a monitored graph node or edge changes the
        following events are raised. The handlers just update the appropriate
        diagram elements:</para>

        <mediaobject>

            <imagedata fileref="Images/image065.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Finally, the source and target of a monitored graph edge may
        change. A diagram edge provides operations sourceReconnected and
        targetReconnected that are used to change the corresponding port that
        the edge connects to.</para>

        <title>Creating a Tool from a Domain Model Instance</title>

        <para>It is often the case that we have an instance of the domain
        model and wish to create a tool that displays the current state of the
        instance and is then used to extend and modify the instance. Using
        XTools this is quite straightforward. We map from the domain instance
        to a tool and create instances of the appropriate tool types. This
        section shows how this is achieved for our graph editor tool.</para>

        <para>To generate a tool from a graph we must create the new tool with
        the appropriate tool type and element manager and then map the nodes
        and edges of the graph to instances of the appropriate tool types. The
        following operation definition adds a new operation to Graph that
        implements the mapping. The source code contains comments explaining
        each of the steps in the mapping:</para>

        </mediaobject>

        <para>The definition of Graph::toTool is a typical example of how to
        define a mapping from a domain instance to an Xtool. We create a tool
        in line 209. The constructor arguments for a tool are the type, an id
        string, the manager and the domain instance. Since a graph is a
        container of nodes and edges, we use auxiliary definitions of toTool
        to map these elements passing the new tool as an argument. Finally, in
        line 230 if we want changes in the domain instance to be reflected in
        the tool we must register the tool as an observer.</para>

        <para>XTool node types consist of a collection of display element
        types. Each display element type is a named attribute of the node.
        When a node is created, the display type is instantiated and its
        instance can be referred to by giving the path from the node (the
        root) to the named display element.</para>

        <para>Each display element type has a textual syntax that is used to
        define it. This section shows you how to define display element types
        by showing each one in the context of the type Node in our graph
        editor example. The general form for the textual definition of a
        display element is:</para>

        <programlisting>@ElementType name(properties)
  attributes
  display components
  menu
end</programlisting>

        <para>The properties of the element type are names and values enclosed
        in parentheses. If no properties are defined then the parentheses
        should be omitted. The attributes of a display element are name/value
        pairs of the form name = value. Typically, the attributes specify the
        maximum and minimum dimensions of the element and features such as
        color. The display components of an element are the contained
        elements; only boxes may contain sub-components. Each element may have
        a menu.</para>

        <para>All elements can be associated with a port in the element’s root
        node. By specifying the property hasport, you associate the instances
        of the element type with a port such that the port will move and
        resize with the instance relative to the containing node.</para>

        <para>Most elements can have a colors. The value of a color attribute
        should be one of the predefined colors: red, green, blue, or should be
        a string “r,g,b” where the three components are integers in the range
        0 to 255 specifying the red, green and blue color contributions
        respectively.</para>

        <para>Many types can be specified with minimum and maximum dimensions.
        By stating these attributes you are placing bounds on the amount that
        instances of the type can be resized. Specifying the same value for
        the minimum and maximum dimensions requires that instances of the type
        are of a fixes size.</para>

        <para>Many types can be padded. A padding attribute specifies the
        amount of space that should be left surrounding instances of the type
        when placing the instance in a display container (such as a box or a
        node). Padding can be specified to the left, right, on top and below
        elements. If the padding attributes are omitted then it is assumed
        that no space need be left between adjacent elements and between
        elements and the borders of their containers.</para>

        <para>All types may specify a layout property. The layout defines how
        instances of the type will be placed within their container. Elements
        may be aligned with their container in which case they stretch to fit
        the size of their container; elements may be left and right justified,
        and centered within a container. Interpretation of the layout property
        depends on the content layout property of the container.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Box</title>

        <para>A box is a container of display elements. A box may have a
        border and may be filled or empty. A box specifies the layout format
        of its contained elements (layout is the subject of a later section).
        Suppose we want to have the label of a node contained within a
        box:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image076.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>The corresponding node type definition is as follows:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image078.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>The syntax for boxes is as follows:<programlisting>@Box name(hasport,hide,contentLayout,layout,nofill)
  minWidth = integer
  minHeight = integer
  maxWidth = integer
  maxHeight = integer
  cornerCurve = integer
  padLeft = integer
  padRight = integer
  padTop = integer
  padBottom = integer
  fillColor = color
  lineColor = color
end</programlisting></para>

        <para>All components of a box definition are optional except for the
        name. If hasport is present then the box defines the location of a
        port in the root node. A hide directive is one of the following
        hideLeft, hideRight, hideTop or hideBottom and may be repeated. A
        content layout directive is one of the following HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL
        or OVERLAY. A layout directive is one of the following: LEFT, RIGHT,
        ALIGN. If nofill is present then the box is not filled. The minimum
        and maximum dimension attributes specify the sized below and above
        which the box cannot be resized. The padding attributes specify the
        white space that is left between the box and its container and
        adjacent elements.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Ellipse</title>

        <para>Ellipses are used to draw ovals and circles. Ellipses are not
        containers of elements, but can be placed in boxes with overlay layout
        to give the impression that they contain element that are displayed
        over them. For example, suppose that we want to have nodes with
        circles around the labels:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image081.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>The node type is defined as follows:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="Images/image083.jpg" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Note that the node type has content layout OVERLAY meaning that
        all the contents will be drawn over each other in the order that they
        appear in the type definition. The contained ellipse type has ALIGN
        layout so that instances grow and shrink with their container. Each
        ellipse is left unfilled.</para>

        <para>The syntax for ellipses is as follows:</para>

        <programlisting>@Ellipse name(hasport,noOutline,layout,nofill)
  minWidth = integer
  minHeight = integer
  maxWidth = integer
  maxHeight = integer
  padLeft = integer
  padRight = integer
  padTop = integer
  padBottom = integer
  fillColor = color
  lineColor = color
end</programlisting>

        <para>All properties and attributes are optional.</para>

      <title>Example Tool: Class Diagrams</title>

      <para>A typical example of a modelling tool is a class diagram editor.
      The domain model is shown below:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/image090.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The interface that we wish to expose over the domain model is the
      ability to create classes and attributes in a single package. The names
      of the classes and attributes can be changed and the types of the
      attributes can be modified. We will make a distinction between builtin
      classes used as attribute types (for example NamedElement::name :
      String) and other classes. Attributes of classes with builtin types will
      be shown inside the class box whereas all other attribute will be
      attached to classes via an edge (such as Attribute::type).</para>

      <para>The domain model is an example of a meta-model in that it
      describes itself and the model has been constructed using the Xtool for
      package editing. Another example, (showing a non-meta model) is a
      standard information model for a Library as follows:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="Images/image092.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The tool type for a package editor is shown below. It contains an
      example of the use of Star to define that part of a class node that
      contains a sequence of attribute definitions. Initially bodyBox will be
      emptyInstances of the display type attribute may be added to, and
      deleted from, bodyBox.</para>
