  <title>XCore</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>XMF provides a collection of classes that form the basis of all
    XMF-Mosaic defined tools. These classes form the kernel of XMF and are
    collectively called XCore. The classes are self-describing: all XCore
    classes are instances of XCore classes. This feature is called
    meta-circularity and is the key to modularity, uniformity and reusability
    throughout all system and user defined XMF tools. </para>

    <para>XCore includes class definitions for the basic types including
    Integer, Boolean and String and collection types for sets and sequences of
    values. XCore is object-oriented, it provides basic notions of Object and
    Class. XCore is executable; it provides definitions for Performable
    entities and Operations. All system defined tools in XMF-Mosaic are
    instances of XCore; therefore tools that are defined to work on instances
    of XCore can be used on any XMF data. For example, general-purpose editors
    and mappings are provided by XMF that are guaranteed to work across all
    system and user defined data.</para>

    <title>The XCore Package</title>

    <para>The contents of the XCore package is shown in the following
    diagram:<mediaobject>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></para>

    <para>The following sections provide a brief summary of each class. Note,
    the XCore model can be explored by clicking on Kernel &gt; XCore in the
    XMF browser.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Attribute</title>

      <para>An attribute is a structural feature of a class. It defines the
      name and type of a slot of the instances of the class. When the class is
      instantiated, a new object is created and a slot is added for each
      attribute defined and inherited by the class. Each slot is initialised
      to contain the default value for the type of the corresponding
      attribute. Constructor: Attribute(name,type) The name is a string and
      the type is a classifier.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Behavioural Feature</title>

      <para>A behavioural feature is a typed element that can be invoked.
      Typically a behavioural feature is an operation.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Bind</title>

      <para>A binding associates a name with a value. Constructor:
      Bind(name,value) Constructs a binding, the name is a string and the
      value is any element.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Classifier</title>

      <para>A classifier is a name space for operations and constraints. A
      classifier is generalizable and has parents from which it inherits
      operations and constraints. A classifier can be instantiated via new/0
      and new/1. In both cases the default behaviour is to return a default
      value as an instance. If the classifier is a datatype then the basic
      value for the datatype is returned otherwise null is returned as the
      default value. A classifier can also be applied to arguments (0 or more)
      in order to instantiate it. Typically you will not create a Classifier
      directly, but create a class or an instance of a sub-class of
      Class.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Class</title>

      <para>XMF-Mosaic is a class-based system. Tools are defined as
      collections of classes whose instances have state and behaviour. The
      XCore class Class defines the essential features of a class. Inheritance
      is used to extend class features in XMF. Since Class is available; user
      defined tools can extend what it means to be a class. This ability is
      the basis for meta-programming. For example, Class may be extended with
      the ability to keep track of all instances or to access instance data
      from an external database. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>CodeBox</title>

      <para>A CodeBox contains compiled code that can be executed on the XMF
      VM.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Collection</title>

      <para>The root class for all collection types.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Compiled Operation</title>

      <para>A CompiledOperation is the type of all XMF compiled operations. A
      compiled operation can be invoked using invoke/2 or by applying it to
      its arguments. A compiled operation consists of machine code
      instructions. A compiled operation may be associated with its source
      code to aid debugging.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Constraint</title>

      <para>A constraint is a named Boolean expression owned by a classifier.
      Constraints are defined by classifiers to be performed with respect to
      their instances and as such any occurrences of self in a constraint will
      refer to the instance that is being checked.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Constraint Report</title>

      <para>A constraint report is produced by sending a classify message to
      an element or a check constraints message to a classifier. A report is a
      tree structured element describing the constraints that were performed
      and their outcomes. Note that internal nodes of the tree may have dummy
      constraint reports used as containers of sub-constraint reports. Such
      dummies have a null constraint and an empty reason, but the satisfied
      Boolean is the conjunction of the sub-reports.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Constructor</title>

      <para>A constructor contains a code body that is invoked on
      instantiation of a classifier.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Contained</title>

      <para>A contained element has an owner. The owner is set when the
      contained element is added to a container. Removing an owned element
      from a container and adding it to another container will change the
      value of owner in the contained element.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Container</title>

      <para>A container has a slot contents that is a table. The table
      maintains the contained elements indexed by keys. By default the leys
      for the elements in the table are the elements themselves, but
      sub-classes of container will modify this feature accordingly. Container
      provides operations for accessing and managing its contents.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Daemon</title>

      <para>Daemons monitor the state of objects and perform actions when the
      object changes state. Daemon technology is the key to implementing a
      variety of modular reusable tool architectures such as the observer
      pattern. XMF-Mosaic uses daemons extensively to synchronize data across
      multiple tools. User defined tools can use daemons to make tools
      reactive and to ensure data is always consistent. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Data Type</title>

      <para>Instances of this meta-class are XMF types for basic data values.
      XMF types include Integer, String, Boolean and Float. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Dependency</title>

      <para>A dependency occurs between a source and a target model element.
      When a dependency is created, the attach operation is performed and when
      it is removed the detach operation is performed. These operations allow
      sub-classes of Dependency to have semantics.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Doc</title>

      <para>A class used to represent documentation.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>DocumentedElement</title>

      <para>A documented element has an attribute doc:Doc, which is used to
      store documentation relating to the element. Any class that can be
      documented should specialize this class.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Element</title>

      <para>All classes in XMF are extensions of the XCore class Element.
      Element defines the essential behaviour of all XMF data. For example
      Element defines features such as being able to produce a printed
      representation and the ability to handle messages. XMF is a dynamically
      extensible system; this means that new behaviour can be added to
      existing classes. This is sometimes referred to as aspect oriented
      programming. Since Element is available, user defined tools can add
      system-wide aspects. For example this can be used to add the ability to
      export any XMF data in any required format (binary encoded, XML, text
      etc).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Enum</title>

      <para>The enumerated type.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Exception</title>

      <para>XMF provides exception handling for dealing with exceptional
      circumstances in running code. The XCore class Exception is the basis
      for a hierarchy of classes that implement specific types of errors.
      Exceptions are raise at the point at which they occur and encapsulate
      data that describes exactly the source of the problem. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>ForeignOperation</title>

      <para>Provides an interface to operations written in external
      programming languages, such as Java.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>IndexedContainer</title>

      <para>An indexed container is a class that manages a hashtable
      associating keys with values. The Container::add/1 operation is
      implemented by IndexedContainer to add the argument as both an index and
      a value. The class IndexedContainer provides a 2-place operation for
      'add' that allows the index to be different from the value. Note that
      'remove/1’ expects to be supplied with the index.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>InterpretedOperation</title>

      <para>An interpreted operation is created when we evaluate an operation
      definition.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Namespace</title>

      <para>A name space is a container of named elements. A name space
      defines two operations getElement/1 and hasElement/1 that are used to
      get an element by name and check for an element by name. Typically a
      name space will contain different categories of elements in which case
      the name space will place the contained elements in its contents table
      and in a type specific collection. For example, a class is a container
      for operations, attributes and constraints. Each of these elements are
      placed in the contents table for the class and in a slot containing a
      collection with the names operations, attributes; and constraints
      respectively. The special syntax :: is used to invoke the getElement/1
      operation on a name space.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>NamedElement</title>

      <para>A named element is an owned element with a name. The name may be a
      string or a symbol. typically we use symbols where the lookup of the
      name needs to be efficient.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Object</title>

      <para>Object is the super-class of all classes with structural features
      in XMF. Object provides access to slots via the get/1 and set/2
      operations. Object is the default super-class for a class definition -
      if you do not specify a super-class then Object is assumed.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Operation</title>

      <para>The basis for all XMF execution is the XCore class Operation. An
      operation has parameters and a body and is equivalent to a standard
      programming language procedure or function. A significant difference to
      conventional procedures is that operations are XMF objects that can be
      created and stored just like any other object. This makes XMF very
      flexible since behaviour can be encapsulated at the appropriate point in
      models and data. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>OrderedCollection</title>

      <para>A container that wraps a collections of ordered elements.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Package</title>

      <para>XMF supports name spaces that contain collections of named
      elements. The XCore class Package is used to structure collections of
      class and sub-package definitions. XMF-Mosaic is structured as a tree of
      packages containing definitions of all aspects of the system (including
      XCore). The root name space is called Root; all XMF classes can be
      referenced via Root. Unlike UML and MOF, XCore packages are subclasses
      of Class. They can therefore be instantiated and can have operations,
      attributes and constraints.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Parameter</title>

      <para>A parameter is a typed element that occurs in operations.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Performable</title>

      <para>XMF provides an environment in which executable languages can be
      conveniently developed. An executable language implements the interface
      defined by the abstract XCore class Performable. XOCL is an example of a
      language that implements this interface. </para>

      <para>XCore is an example of a language that can be performed by XVM.
      XVM may be initialised with different kernel language definitions
      although in practice, XVM relies on a small sub-set of XCore being
      present. This feature allows XMF to deploy embedded systems that run
      application code without requiring the tools that were used in
      XMF-Mosaic to develop the application.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Resource</title>

      <para>A resource records where the resource originated via a resource
      name. For example a definition is a resource that records the file where
      it was loaded from.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Seq</title>

      <para>Seq is a sub-class of DataType. All sequence data types are an
      instance of Seq. Seq defines an attribute elementType that is used to
      record the type of the elements in a sequence data type.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Set</title>

      <para>Set is a sub-class of DataType. All set data types are an instance
      of Set. Set defines an attribute elementType that is used to record the
      type of the elements in a set data type.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Snapshot</title>

      <para>A snapshot is collection of objects. A snapshot is an instanceOf
      another element (typically a package), which contains elements which
      classify the contents of the snapshot.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>StructuralFeature</title>

      <para>This is an abstract class that is the super-class of all classes
      that describe structural features. For example Attribute is a sub-class
      of StructuralFeature. Other types of structural feature are possible by
      managing the internal structure of objects via a MOP.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Table</title>

      <para>A table associates keys with values. Any element can be used as a
      key. A table has an initial size and can support any number of values.
      Use hasKey/1 to determine whether a table contains a key. Use get/1 to
      access a table via a key and put/2 to update a table given a key and a
      value. Use keys/0 to access the set of keys for a table.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Thread</title>

      <para>A thread is a unit of concurrent execution. When a thread is
      created, it continues processing on the XVM until either it performs a
      read operation that blocks on input or when it explicitly calls yield.
      All XOCL values implement the yield operation. In both cases the thread
      is said to yield control. When a thread yields control, the XOS
      schedules another thread that is waiting. The scheduling algorithm aims
      to ensure that all waiting threads get scheduled providing that they
      yield.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>TypedElement</title>

      <para>A typed element is a named element with an associated type. The
      type is a classifier. This is an abstract class and is used (for
      example) to define Attribute.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Unordered Collection</title>

      <para>A container that wraps a collections of unordered elements.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Vector</title>

      <para>A vector is a fixed length array of elements. They are created
      using the constructor Vector(). Vectors provide very efficient insert
      (put/2) and lookup operations (ref/1).</para>
    </section>
