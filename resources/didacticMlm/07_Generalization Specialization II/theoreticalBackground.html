		<h1>LU7 - Pitfalls of Specialization and Delegation</h1>
        <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
        <p>Class-based object-oriented languages (like UML, Java, or C#) implement an <i>intensional notion</i> 
		of class. That is, each object must be an instance of one and only class. For some domain objects, however, 
		this might be unsuited, lead to redundancies in the model and, as such, pose a threat to model integrity. 
		Often, this integrity threat results from inadequate uses of generalization/specialization relationships.</p>
		
		<p><u>Example</u>: In an information system of a university, we have three classes: <code>Student</code>, 
		<code>Employee</code>, and <code>Person</code>. <code>Person</code> is the superclass of <code>Student</code> 
		and <code>Employee</code>. On the one hand, this generalization/specialization relationship is beneficial 
		because it allows to inherit properties that are shared among <code>Student</code> and <code>Employee</code> 
		(e.g., first name and last name). However, a particular student might also be an employee at the university - 
		the classes are overlapping. To model that a student is also an employee, we need to manage two different and 
		unrelated objects: one student object and one employee object. The generalization/specialization relationship 
		then causes redundancy in the model because both objects provide values for the attributes inherited from <code>Person</code>
		 (e.g., first name).</p>

		<p>To overcome this issue, we would use <i>delegation</i> associations. In delegation we differentiate a 
		<i>role object</i> (e.g., a student object) from a <i>role-filler object</i> (e.g., a person object). 
		If an object sends a request to a student object (e.g., the exam registration office requires the student's address), 
		and the student object cannot handle the message, it is delegated to its role-filler object. Continuing the example from above, 
		we would now require one person (role-filler) object and one student and one employee (role) objects. Shared properties like name 
		or address are no longer redundantly defined in each object, but only in the role-filler object.
		This allows us to realize the benefits of generalization/specialization without comprising on redundancy issues.</p>
