        <h1>LU3 - Multiplicities of Attributes</h1>
        <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
        <p>Similar to associations, each attribute must specify a <i>multiplicity</i>. 
        The multiplicity of an attribute specifies the number of values that may be or must be entered for its slots. 
        If the maximum multiplicity of an attribute is higher than one, a sequence of values may be entered. 
        This corresponds to known data structures like arrays or lists that contain multiple values. 
		In the regular UML, the default multiplicity is [1..1]. 
		In UML++, the default multiplicity of an attribute is [0â€¦*], i.e., any number of slot values may be entered.
		</p>
		<p>Multiplicity of attributes can not yet be altered in UML-MX. This learning unit does contain any self-assessment exercises. 
		The example model below showcases slots with 0, 1, and many values.
