        <h1>2. Theoretical Background:</h1>
        <p>Similar to association, each attribute must specify a multiplicity. 
        The multiplicity of an attribute specifies the number of values that may be or must be entered for its slots. 
        In UML++, the default multiplicity of an attribute is [0â€¦*], i.e., any number of slot values may be entered. 
        If the maximum multiplicity of an attribute is higher than one, a sequence of values may be entered. 
        This corresponds to known data structures like arrays or lists that contain multiple values. 
		Multiplicity of attributes can not yet be altered in <b>UML-MX</b>. This learning unit does contain any self-assessment exercises. 
		The example model below showcases slots with 0, 1, and many values.
