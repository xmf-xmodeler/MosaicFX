        <h1>2. Theoretical Background:</h1>
        <p>Associations serve to connect classes. An association must always have exactly one source class and exactly one target class. 
        Typically, the source and target class will be different. If the source and target class are the same, 
        the class is called <i>self-referential</i> (see LU-8 for more on this special case).  
        Each association has a non-unique name. The distinction between source and target of an association determines its reading direction.
        Example: we have two classes <b>Student</b> and <b>"Teacher"</b> and assocation <b>“teaches”</b> between them. 
        If Student is the source class and Teacher the target class, the model expresses that a student teaches a teacher. 
        The reading direction is indicated by the black arrow next to the association name.</p>
        <p>
		The instance of an association is called a <i>link</i>. If two classes are connected by an association, 
		their respective objects may be (or must be) <i>linked</i> with one another. The number of links that may 
		or must exist between objects of the source and target class depends on the multiplicity of the association. 
		Both association ends must specify a multiplicity with a minimum and a maximum value. 
		Example: A <b>Teacher</b> class has a teaches association to a <b>Student</b> class. 
		The multiplicity at the <b>Student</b> end express how many <b>students</b> are taught by a single <b>teacher</b> 
		(reading: "Teacher teaches at least X, at most Y students"), 
		the multiplicity at the <b>Teacher</b> end expresses how many <b>teachers</b> teach a single <b>student</b> 
		(reading: "Student is taught by at least X, at most Y teachers"). 
		In technical terms, we express how many links an object of a respective class may possess. 
		If we add a multiplicity of “1..20” to the Student end (reading: "a teacher teaches at least 1, at most 20 students"), 
		each teacher object must have at least one link and may have at most 20 links to student objects. 
		The maximum multiplicity may also be unbound. This is represented by a <b>*</b> in a UML++ diagram.
		</p>

		Especially for experienced programmers, associations are sometimes difficult to grasp because they are not matched 
		by a corresponding concept in programming languages. In common object-oriented programming 
		languages like Java or C#, an association will be implemented as an attribute. 
		But there is an important conceptual difference between both. Associations serve as <i>references</i> between classes, 
		links as <i>references</i> between objects. Only objects posses their own identity; slots do not. 
		Slots require initialization for each new object that is being created.  
		Example: Customers must specify exactly one location where they live. 
		The location is determined by a single String value. Should the location be modeled as an attribute of customer 
		or as a separate class <b>Customer</b> is associated with? In the first case (location as attribute), 
		we must enter a new location for each customer. But locations posses their own identity; many customers may 
		live at the same location. If the name of one location changes, the change affects every customer that lives there. 
		If location were an attribute of customer, we would have to change all affected customer objects. 
		If location is a separate class associated with customer, we only need to change the affected location object. 
		Note that this way of thinking also applies if the type is more complex. Consider for example the price of a product. 
		Price may consist of a "value: Float" and a "currency: String" value, i.e., is too complex to depict as a single attribute. 
		But it should still be modeled as an attribute since price objects do not possess their own identity-
		if one product's price changes from 4.99€ to 2.99€, I don’t to want to change the price value of all 4.99€-priced products. 
		In such a case, we would use a <i>domain-specific</i> type for the price attribute (see LU-5).
		</p>
		<p>
		At last, the navigability of an association must be defined. References between classes may be bidirectional, 
		i.e., the source can access the target and vice versa, but it can also be unidirectional, i.e., 
		the source can access the target but the target cannot access the source. 
		The navigability of an association is indicated by an arrow at each association end. 
		Bidirectional associations are the default. Arrows are not displayed in bidirectional association for improved readability.
