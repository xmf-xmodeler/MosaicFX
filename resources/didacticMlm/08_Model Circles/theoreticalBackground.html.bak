		<h1>LU8 - Model Circles</h1>
        <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
		<p>Class diagrams consist of classes that are interrelated by 
			associations. If a class is associated with itself – either 
			directly (what we call a <i>self-referential class</i>, see <lu>LU2</lu>) or indirectly – we 
			encouter a so-called <i>model circle</i>. Model circles pose a threat to 
			referential integrity.</p>
<p>			<u>Example:</u> A simple example would be to model a  
			class <code>Employee</code> and add a self-referential association 
			<code>is_superior_of</code>. Such an association would also allow an employee to 
			be its own superior, which might be unsuited for the modeled domain.
			</p><p>Model circles may be useful or sometimes 
			unavoidable even if they pose threats to model integrity. In such 
			cases, integrity-violating states should be prevented by specifying 
			custom constraints. Custom constraints are explained in <lu>LU10</lu>. The 
			example model includes a model circle.</p>
