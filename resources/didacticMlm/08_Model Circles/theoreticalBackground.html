		<h1>2. Theoretical Background:</h1>
		<p>Class diagrams consist of classes that are interrelated by
			associations. If a class A is associated with itself – either
			directly (what we call a self-referential class) or indirectly – we
			encouter a so-called model circle. Model circles pose a threat to
			referential integrity. A simple example would be to model a single
			class employee and add a self-referential association
			“is_superior_of”. Such an association would also allow an employee to
			be its own superior. Model circles may be useful or sometimes
			unavoidable even if they pose threats to model integrity. In such
			cases, integrity-violating states should be prevented by specifying
			custom constraints. Custom constraints are explained in LU10. The
			example model includes a model circle. Description of violation</p>
