		<h1>2. Theoretical Background</h1>
		<p>
			Generalization/Specialization is a central feature of object-oriented
			languages. While classification (see LU1) serves as an abstraction
			over objects, generalization serves as an abstraction over classes. A
			generalized class is called the superclass or ancestor of its
			specialized classes, which are referred to as subclasses or
			descendants. The key mechanism of specialization is inheritance.
			Through <i>inheritance</i> all properties that are specified in the
			superclass are available to all subclasses. These properties may be
			overwritten (and results in a form of <i>polymorphy</i>, not
			discussed here) and extended. “Extended” means that each subclass may
			add their own properties which are not available to any other
			subclass. Through generalization/specialization, we desire to
			construct more general abstractions and aim at improving reusability
			and maintainability. Subclasses should always serve as a substitute
			to its superclass (the <i>substitution principle</i>). A violation to
			this principle might lead to violations of model integrity.
			Sometimes, it is reasonable to add generalization/specialization
			hierarchies to realize benefits of reusability and maintainability
			only. In such cases, we might want to prohibit that superclasses can
			be instantiated into objects themselves. To prohibit the
			instantiation of objects, we can make the class abstract. An abstract
			class is a class which cannot be instantiated. Further difficulties
			of generalization/Specialization are discussed in LU7.

		<h1>Illustration in Tool:</h1>
		<h2>A: Inheritance</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Show class diagram with potential for inheritance (same
				attributes, same association)
				<ul>
					<li>Important: clarify that these classes also share a common,
						conceptual ancestor -> reusability and maintainability depend on
						the quality of the abstraction</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Introduce superclass and inherit all properties.</li>
			<li>Show object diagram: properties of superclass are also
				available.</li>
			<li>But: we can also instantiate the superclass. We want to
				avoid this by making our superclass abstract.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>B: Substitutability principle</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Show class diagram where substitutability constraint is
				violated.</li>
			<li>Show object diagram that leads to confusion.</li>
		</ol>
