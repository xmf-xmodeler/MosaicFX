        <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
		<p>
			<i>Generalization/specialization</i> is a central feature of object-oriented 
			languages. While classification (see <lu>LU1</lu>) serves as an abstraction 
			over objects, generalization serves as an abstraction over classes. A 
			generalized class is called the <i>superclass</i>, parent class, or ancestor of its 
			specialized classes, which are referred to as <i>subclasses</i> or 
			descendants. </p>
			<p>
			The key mechanism of specialization is <i>inheritance</i>. 
			Through inheritance, all properties (i.e., attributes, operations, constraints, associations) 
			that are specified in the superclass are available to all subclasses. These properties may be 
			overwritten (and result in a form of <i>polymorphy</i>, not 
			discussed here) and extended. “Extended” means that each subclass may 
			add their own properties which are not available to any other 
			subclass. Through generalization/specialization, we desire to 
			construct more general abstractions and aim at improving reusability 
			and maintainability. </p>
			<p>
			A superclass should always serve as a substitute 
			to its subclasses (the <i>substitution principle</i>). A violation to 
			this principle might lead to violations of model integrity. 
			Sometimes, it is reasonable to add generalization/specialization 
			hierarchies to realize benefits of reusability and maintainability 
			only. In such cases, we might want to prohibit that superclasses can 
			be instantiated into objects themselves. To prohibit the 
			instantiation of objects, we can make a class abstract. An <i>abstract 
			class</i> is a class which cannot be instantiated. Further difficulties 
			of generalization/specialization are discussed in <lu>LU7</lu>.
