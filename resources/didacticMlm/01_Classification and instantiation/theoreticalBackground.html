		<h1>LU1 - Classification and Instantiation</h1>
        <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
		<p><i>Instantiation</i> refers to the process of creating an object from 
			a given class. In class-based object-oriented languages (such as the 
			UML, Java, and most other object-oriented languages), the 
			specification of a class must always precede the creation of objects.</p> 
			
		<p>Each class has a unique name and specifies different properties. 
			Properties of classes are <i>attributes</i>, <i>associations</i>, <i>operations</i>, and 
			<i>constraints</i>. In this learning unit, we focus on attributes only. 
			Associations are discussed in <lu>LU2</lu>, operations in <lu>LU9</lu>, and constraints 
			in <lu>LU10</lu>. Classes may contain an arbitrary number of attributes. Each 
			attribute consists of a name, a <i>type</i>, and a <i>multiplicity</i> (discussed in <lu>LU3</lu>). 
			The type of an attribute determines its range of allowed values and permitted operations. Some data types are included 
			as part of UML++. These include: String (for any textual input), 
			integer (for integers), float (for floating-point numbers), and 
			Boolean (for Boolean values). More advanced, custom types for 
			attributes are discussed in <lu>LU4</lu>. </p>
			
			<p>The term <i>initialization</i> refers to 
			the initial assignment of attribute values to objects. Initialization 
			can only succeed the instantiation of an object. The value of an 
			attribute in a given object is called the <i>slot</i> of an object.</p>
			
			<p>The example model includes a class representing the concept Student with 
			two instantiated objects representing particular students. Changes to the class will reflect 
			in its instances. You can also add more classes or change the current values. 
			If you require help using UML-MX, revisit the UML++ introduction or look at our online tutorials.</p>
