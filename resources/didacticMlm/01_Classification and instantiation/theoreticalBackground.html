		<h1>2. Theoretical Background:</h1>
		<p>Instantiation refers to the process of creating an object from 
			a given class. In class-based object-oriented languages (such as the 
			UML, Java, and most other object-oriented languages), the 
			specification of a class must always precede the creation of objects. 
			Each class has a unique name and specifies different properties. 
			Properties of classes are attributes, associations, operations, and 
			constraints. In this learning unit, we focus on attributes only.
			Associations are discussed in LU2, operations in LU9, and constraints 
			in LU10. Classes may contain an arbitrary amount of attributes. Each 
			attribute consists of a name and a type. The type of an attribute 
			determines its range of allowed values. Some data types are included 
			as part of UML++. These include: String (for any textual input), 
			integer (for integers), float (for floating-point numbers), and 
			Boolean (for Boolean values). More advanced, custom types for 
			attributes are discussed in LU4. The term initialization refers to 
			the initial assignment of attribute values to objects. Initialization 
			can only succeed the instantiation of an object. The value of an 
			attribute in a given object is called the slot of an object.</p>

		<h1>Illustration in Tool:</h1>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Show exemplary class with no attributes
				<ul>
					<li>“We will begin by constructing a custom class with the
						name Student.”</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Instantiate class into multiple objects
				<ul>
					<li>“We can instantiate this class into as many objects as we
						want. Note that each object has its own name. You should not
						confuse the name of the software object with names of domain
						objects. If, e.g., I refer to particular persons by name, the name
						should be captured through a separate attribute.”</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Add attributes to the initial class
				<ul>
					<li>“…But our class currently specifies no single attribute.
						And, as a result, none of our objects contain any slots. Let us
						add some attributes to our class Student to change that. We can
						say that each student has a firstname and a lastname. Those are
						examples of String attributes. Each student also has a
						matriculation number. In our example, we also want to capture
						whether a student is currently enrolled in a particular program.
						For this purpose, we add an attribute “isEnrolled” of type
						Boolean.”</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Initialize the attributes in the objects
				<ul>
					<li>“Our student objects have not yet been properly
						initialized, though. …”</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
