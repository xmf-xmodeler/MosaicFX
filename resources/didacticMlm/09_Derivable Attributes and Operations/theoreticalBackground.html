		<h1>2. Theoretical Background:</h1>
		<p>
			In the examples and exercises of the preceding learning units, slot
			values had to be entered manually. In some cases, however, they might
			also be determined by calculation. The attributes of such slots are
			called <i>derivable attributes</i>. Derivable attributes are
			attributes the value of which is either (i) already indirectly
			available within the model or (ii) dependent on some other attribute
			with a constant value not yet depicted within the model. That is, the
			slots of derivable attributes can be <i>calculated</i> rather then
			entered manually. This calculation requires the use of operations.
			Operations consist of a signature and an operation body. The
			signature determines the name of the operation, its input parameters
			(each of which has a name and a type), and its return type.
			Operations are specified at the class level (they are a property of
			classes) and executed at the object level. UML++ uses the Executable
			Object Constraint Language (XOCL) for the specification of
			operations. The XOCL is a variant of the widely distributed OCL
			standard.

		<h1>Illustration in Tool:</h1>
		<h2>For (i): “already available in model”</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Show class and object diagram with derivable attribute of
				kind (i).
				<ul>
					<li>For example: number of products ordered, total amount of
						order</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Change object diagram so that derivable slot violates model
				integrity</li>
			<li>Add operation that automatically calculates value</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>For (ii): “dependent on some other attribute not yet 
			depicted”</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Show class and object diagram with derivable attribute of
				kind (ii) (e.g., age)</li>
			<li>Show explanation why this may violate model integrity</li>
			<li>Add “base” attribute the derivable attribute is dependent on
				(e.g., dateOfBirth)</li>
			<li>Add operation that automatically calculates derivable slot</li>
			<li>Change base attribute to showcase dynamic calculation</li>
		</ol>
