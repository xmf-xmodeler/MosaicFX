        <p>Generalization/Specialization is a central feature of object-oriented languages. While classification (see LU1) serves as an abstraction over objects, generalization serves as an abstraction over classes. A generalized class is called the superclass or ancestor of its specialized classes, which are referred to as subclasses or descendants. The key mechanism of specialization is inheritance. Through inheritance all properties that are specified in the superclass are available to all subclasses. These properties may be overwritten (and results in a form of polymorphy, not discussed here) and extended. “Extended” means that each subclass may add their own properties which are not available to any other subclass. Through generalization/specialization, we desire to construct more general abstractions and aim at improving reusability and maintainability. Subclasses should always serve as a substitute to its superclass (the substitution principle). A violation to this principle might lead to violations of model integrity. Sometimes, it is reasonable to add generalization/specialization hierarchies to realize benefits of reusability and maintainability only. In such cases, we might want to prohibit that superclasses can be instantiated into objects themselves. To prohibit the instantiation of objects, we can make the class abstract. An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated. Further difficulties of generalization/Specialization are discussed in LU7.
