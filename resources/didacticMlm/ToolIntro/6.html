        <h2>6. Adding Customers and Tickets</h2>
        <p>Great! Now our local cinema has entered one movie and one movie showing. 
		At last, we want to add customers and tickets. To make things a little easier, we have already done this for you. 
		Because we do not know where you placed your elements, your diagram could look a little chaotic now. 
		Just move the elements by drag and drop so you have everything in place.</p>
       		<p> Josie Dough now also buys a ticket for a movie showing of Joker. <b> Add a new ticket object and link it with 
		Josie Dough and the movie showing of Joker.</b> For this purpose, the cinema must allow one customer to buy multiple tickets.
		Change the multiplicity of the “buys” association from 0..1 to <b>0..*</b>.</p>
		<p>You must enter a price for the new ticket object that is higher than 0.0.</p>

		<h3>How To Change the Multiplicity of an Association</h3>
		<p>The simplest way to change the multiplicity of an association is by double-clicking on the respective multiplicity.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, you can either double-click on the line of an association
		or right-click on it and select <strong>'Edit'</strong>.
		In either case, a window will open where you can adjust the multiplicity.</p>
		<p><u>Hint</u>: In the first way, you can only change the specific multiplicity that was clicked on, 
		whereas in the other two ways, you can adjust all cardinalities.</p>
