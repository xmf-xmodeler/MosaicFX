        <h2>6. Adding Customers and Tickets</h2>
        <p>Great! Now our local cinema has entered one movie and one movie showing. 
		At last, we want to add customers and tickets. To make things a little easier, we have already done this for you. 
		Because we do not know where you placed your elements, your diagram could look a little chaotic now. 
		Just move the elements by drag and drop so you have everything in place.</p>
        <p>The cinema wants to allow one customer to buy multiple tickets. 
		This allows a customer object to be linked to multiple ticket objects. 
		Change the multiplicity of the “buys” association from 0..1 to <b>0..*</b>.</p>
		<p>Show your skills by associating Josie Dough with another movie of your choice. 
		Create all needed elements and links. Do not change the identifier of the objects and set all slot values. 
		The ticket price should be different to 10.60.</p>

		<h3>How To Change the Multiplicity of an Association</h3>
		<p>The simplest way to change the multiplicity of an association is by double-clicking on the respective multiplicity.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, you can either double-click on the line of an association
		or right-click on it and select <strong>'Edit'</strong>.
		In either case, a window will open where you can adjust the multiplicity.</p>
		<p><u>Hint</u>: In the first way, you can only change the specific multiplicity that was clicked on, 
		whereas in the other two ways, you can adjust all cardinalities.</p>
