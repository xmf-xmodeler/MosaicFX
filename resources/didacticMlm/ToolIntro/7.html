        <h2>7. Adding Rating Attribute and Enumeration</h2>
        <p>The customer Josie Dough has bought a ticket for the showing of Joker on 7 Nov 2024. Movies have a rating dependent on the age. Joker is rated R and may not be watched from anyone under the age of 17. To automatically verify a customer is old enough to watch a particular movie, we must capture a customer’s age and the movie’s rating. Josie’s age is calculated automatically based on her dateOfBirth. This is done using a method. Later we will get more in details about functions.</p>
        <p>We must still capture the rating of movie objects, though. First, we add an attribute rating: String to our class movie.</p>
        <p>Note, however, that now any string is valid for this attribute. A rating system is restricted to a particular set of values, though. To restrict our attribute to this set of values, we add an enumeration.</p>
        <p>Create an enumeration with the name “RatingEnum”. It is good practice to end the name of each enumeration with Enum, so it will not be confused with other data types.</p>
        <p>We add three values to our RatingEnum: “G” for general audiences, “PG_13” for parents strongly cautioned, and “R” for restricted.</p>
