        <h2>9. Adding requiredAgeToWatch Operation</h2>
        <p>We add an operation "requiredAgeToWatch():Integer" that returns the required age to watch a particular movie based on its rating. Operations in the XModelerML are written with a language called XOCL. Within this introductory example, you do not need to write the code yourself. It was automatically added to the class.</p>
        <p>If we now add the Rating "R" to our "movie1" object, the operation "requiredAgeToWatch()" returns the value "17". If Josie wants to buy a ticket for Joker, she must be at least 17 years old!</p>
		<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Feel free to experiment with the value of the attribute "rating" 
		to see how it affects the result of the operation "requiredAgeToWatch()".
        <p>As long as there is no task for you, you can just go on by clicking the condition check button.</p>
