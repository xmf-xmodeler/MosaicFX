		<h1>2. Theoretical Background</h1>
		<p>
			The term <b>‘object’</b> serves as a linguistic bridge between an
			everyday notion of object and a technical notion of object. This may
			sometimes lead to a confusion of software and physical objects in
			that classes may reproduce deficiencies of natural-language
			categories. A too narrow replication of everday objects as software
			objects can lead to redundancies and, as a result, poses a threat to
			the system’s integrity. Classes that reproduce deficiencies of
			natural-language terms, and with that lead to conceptual redudancy,
			are called deficient classes. Cosider as an example the
			natural-language term <b>“book,”</b> which may refer to a particular
			book copy I can hold in my hand or also to the intellectual artifact
			that a copy represents. As such, both of the following expressions
			are valid in everyday communication: “She is reading a book.”
			(referring to a particular book copy) “Moby Dick is a book.” (not
			referring to any particular printed copy, but to the intellectual
			artifact) To replicate this ambiguity in object models may lead to
			redundancies and thus threatens the integrity of the system. Example:
			A <b>library</b> manages <b>books</b> that can be borrowed. A single
			class <b>Book</b> may serve to represent all exemplars the library
			possesses and include the attributes “title: String” and “id:
			String”. The attribute “title: String” would, however, lead to
			redundancies and threaten system integrity since multiple copies
			(each with its own id) share the same title (because they are copies
			of the same intellectual artifact). The example model shows how an
			improved version of such a scenario might look like.

			<li>Show class diagram with deficient class
				<ul>
					<li>“Consider the small example model of a library where
						customers can lend books. (Show diagram with two classes, Customer
						and Book, and a “lends” association between them). Superficially,
						this diagram may look accurate and suited for our purposes. But a
						closer look at possible instantiations yields shortcomings of the
						model.”</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Instantiate objects of deficient class
				<ul>
					<li>The customer with the name “Grace Trinity” lends the book
						entitled “Catcher in the Rye”. Now the customer “Joey Henson” also
						lends the book entitled “Catcher in the Rye”. But the same book,
						as modeled here, cannot be borrowed multiple times. So what
						happened here? The class Book showcases deficiencies in that
						single copies of book are confused with the intellectual artifact.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Show improved class diagram
				<ul>
					<li>“A closer analysis of the domain yields that the original
						class book can be dissected into multiple classes: BookCopy and
						BookArtifact. The dissection into multiple classes also avoids
						conceptual redundancy…”</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Show improved object diagram
				<ul>
					<li>“… For now, we only require a single BookArtifact object.
						Namely, to represent our book Catcher in the Rye. This avoids a
						redundant specification of the same book title, author and further
						information related to the intellectual artifact.”</li>
