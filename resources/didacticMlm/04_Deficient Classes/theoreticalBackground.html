		<h1>LU4 - Deficient Classes</h1>
        <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
		<p>
			The term object serves as a linguistic bridge between an 
			everyday notion of object and a technical notion of object. This may 
			sometimes lead to a confusion of software and physical objects in 
			that classes may reproduce deficiencies of natural-language 
			concepts. A too narrow replication of everday objects as software 
			objects can lead to redundancies and, as a result, poses a threat to 
			the system’s integrity. Classes that reproduce deficiencies of 
			natural-language terms, and with that lead to conceptual redundancy, 
			are called <i>deficient classes</i>.</p>
<p>			Cosider as an example the natural-language term “book,” which may refer to a particular 
			book copy I can hold in my hand or also to the intellectual artifact 
			that a copy represents. As such, both of the following expressions 
			are valid in everyday communication: “She is reading a book.” 
			(referring to a particular book copy) “Moby Dick is a book.” (not 
			referring to any particular printed copy, but to the intellectual 
			artifact). To replicate this ambiguity in object models may lead to 
			redundancies and thus threatens the integrity of the system. <u>Example</u>: 
			A library manages books that can be borrowed. A single 
			class <code>Book</code> may serve to represent all exemplars the library 
			possesses and includes the attributes <code>title: String</code> and <code>id: 
			String</code>. The attribute <code>title: String</code> would, however, lead to 
			redundancies and threaten system integrity since multiple copies 
			(each with its own id) share the same title (because they are copies 
			of the same intellectual artifact). The example model shows how an 
			improved version of such a scenario might look like.
