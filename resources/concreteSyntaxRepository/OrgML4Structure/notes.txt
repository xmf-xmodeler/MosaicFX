Bugs:
-If you try to use svgs, which path can´t be found no svg will be presented
-Performance Problems -> See Performance Problem XML
-Consequence SHOW_NEVER only works with id´s in SVG 


Possible Features:
Make Constraints as a Condition for a Modification

The Update Diagram-Button at the tool should be updated
Concrete Syntax Editor -> revert actions function


It should be implemented, that you can turn of the concrete syntax
Would be nice to have the chance to define modifications in an abstract syntax
