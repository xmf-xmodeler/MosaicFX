Bugs:
-If you try to use svgs, which path can´t be found no svg will be presented
-If you use Import of abstract syntax, you can´t use the concrete syntax wizard

Possible Features:
The Update Diagram-Button at the tool should be updated
Concrete Syntax Editor -> revert actions function
Add Labels per Syntax Editor
Make Constraints as a Condition for a Modification
It should be implemented, that you can turn of the concrete syntax
Would be nice to have the chance to define modifications in an abstract syntax 
OpValueCompareFunction ?? 
Update concrete syntax on Update-Button


Questions:
Can i just add labels with text in XML
What is the meaning of the second id by read from slot
What means the id in the import meta tag?
Wo kommen dnen die groups her bei den optical consequences?
By the SlotNumCompareCondition are the bounds exclusive?
