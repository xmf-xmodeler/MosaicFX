7. The customer Josie Dough has bought a ticket for the showing of Joker on 7 Nov 2024. But Joker is rated R and may not be watched from any one under the age of 17. To automatically verify a customer is old enough to watch a particular movie, we must capture a customer’s age and the movie’s rating. Josie’s age is calculated automatically based on here dateOfBirth. We must still capture the rating of movie objects, though.
First, we add an attribute rating: String to the our class movie. …
Note, however, that now any string is valid for this attribute. A rating system is restricted to particular set of values, though. To restrict our attribute to this set of values, we add an enumeration.
Create an enumeration with the name “RatingEnum”. It is good practice to end the name of each enumeration with Enum, so it will not be confused with other data types.
We add three values to our RatingEnum: “G” for general audiences, “PG_13” for parents strongly cautioned, and “R” for restricted. We must change the data type of our attribute rating from String to RatingEnum.
