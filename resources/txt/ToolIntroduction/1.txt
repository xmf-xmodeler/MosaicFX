        <h1>1. Movie Class Example</h1>
        <p>Okay, let us begin with a simple example: A local cinema wants to manage its ticket selling system.</p>
        <p>Create a class that serves to represent movies. Per convention, classes always begin with an uppercase letter and are in the singular form. Hence, name the class <strong>“Movie”</strong> and not <strong>“movies”</strong>.</p>
        <p>Remember that a class serves as an abstraction over a set of objects. In our small example, we assume that each particular movie object has a title and a duration. To enable this, we must add the respective attributes to our created class.</p>
