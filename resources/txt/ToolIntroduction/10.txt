        <h2>10. Introduction to XModelerML UML++ Modeling Tool</h2>
        <p>We can execute an automatic validity check by adding constraints. We can add the constraint “mayWatchMovie” to our class Ticket. Constraints are again written in XOCL and for the purpose of this introduction the required code is added automatically.</p>
        <p>An error pops up! Our object diagram is invalid because Josie is not allowed to buy a ticket for Joker. To resolve the error, we can delete the ticket object.</p>
        <p>And that’s our small introduction to the XModelerML UML++ Modeling Tool. Exit the introduction by hitting the update button.</p>
