		<h3>3. Step: Select Enumeration As The Data Type</h3>
		<p> If there is no attribute that the enumeration should use as a data type, 
		first add the attribute (as explained earlier) and enter the name of your enumeration as the data type. 
		<u>Hint</u>: You can also select your enumeration from the drop-down menu under <strong>'Type'</strong>. 
		To display it, you need to first check the box next to <strong>'Show non primitive data types'</strong>.</p>
		<p>If an attribute with a defined data type already exists, as in our case,
		right-click on the appropriate class and select <strong>'Attribute'</strong> and then <strong>'Change type'</strong>. 
		In the window that will open, select the attribute from the <strong>'Select Attribute'</strong> drop-down menu and enter the name of your enumeration as the new data type.
		<u>Hint</u>: Close the window by clicking on "<i>OK</i>". In this case, <i>Enter</i> will not work.</p>
