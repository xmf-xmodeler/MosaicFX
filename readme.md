# XModeler

### What is XModeler?
The XModeler allows multiple levels of classification and enables you to model, program and define new languages – all at the same time.
Create models, program, define your own languages and create corresponding editors on the fly. Navigate through its entire foundation – and change it, if you want.
It enables relaxing essential conflicts of system design and the construction of self-referential information which
* feature a common representation of models and code
* provide users with models of the software they use
* empower users to adapt the system to their needs are aware of the context it operates in
